The functional specification details:

* Who are the users and what do they know

* What information users want from the system 

* Use cases - how users interact with the system to get the information they want
What information the user provides
E.g., command entered with its options
What responses the system provides
E.g., prompts, plots, error messages

* Describe components with sufficient detail so that someone with modest knowledge of the project can implement the code for the component.
