 translation for me i should mention that im talking about rock and pop live
 albums obviously styles like jazz rely on the spontaneity of a live performance
 to be effective even most jazz studio albums are performed in live takes maybe
 its just my love of production and the completeness that truly great studio
 records have or the fact that a lot of bands dont do much to distance their
 performances from the studio versions of their songs but live albums usually go
 back on the shelf after one or two listens never to be heard from again in my
 house
 
 im not sure if id call this echo and the bunnymen live record an exception to
 that rule i definitely enjoy their studio material more but i can say that
 ive been spinning live in liverpool on a pretty regular basis since it
 arrived in the mail and as live albums go its a pretty impressive showing now
 a duo consisting of ian mcculloch and will sergeant the bunnymen have assembled
 an able muscular backing band and chosen a set list that gathers songs from
 throughout their career for what amounts essentially to a fantastic live career
 retrospective
 
 most of the versions presented by the band here faithfully recall the songs
 original incarnations and longtime fans should be more than pleased with what
 they hear echo and the bunnymen are one of only a handful of older bands out
 there who havent really lost any of their vitality and these performances
 bristle with the enthusiasm and energy of a much younger band when the guys
 dip into their postreunion catalog it often sounds a great deal more charged
 than those songs studio counterparts
 
 thats especially true of the three tracks taken from last years flowers
 an album that saw them returning to their dark postpunk roots they take
 eternity turns at breakneck speed but mccullochs voice is clear and even
 throughout the song and sergeants heavily effected guitar work is simply
 sterling king of kings is even more psychedelicized here than on the album
 with sergeant throwing up scudding clouds of guitar to offset mcculloch and the
 bands stable delivery the band also tackles buried alive and supermellow
 man from that album in spirited versions that rival the originals in terms of
 sheer charisma
 
 aside from a somewhat lackluster rendition of nothing lasts forever from 1997s
 evergreen the band sticks to some of the best songs of their 80s heyday
 drawing at least one from every album they released in their original incarnation
 as a quartet expectedly ocean rain figures the most prominently with fully
 amped versions of seven seas and my kingdom and a propulsive reading of the
 killing moon confirming that albums timelessness the slow take on ocean rain
 that closes the album is unfortunately less than exciting but well delivered
 nonetheless
 
 the two biggest highlights of the album both reach back to the bands 1979 debut
 crocodiles the band rips and snorts its way through all that jazz with
 both sergeant and mcculloch tearing into their guitars while some hired heads
 bash out the rhythmic backing with abandon rescue opens things in a similarly
 pounding fashion and the cheering audience knows exactly what to expect when
 sergeant lays into the massive guitar lick that kicks the song off mccullochs
 voice warms into the song a bit but by the end hes belting out the words as
 loudly as ever
 
 another early peak is the single never stop a song that never made its way onto
 any of the bands proper albums but proves to be one of their best with its loose
 policey groove and sweeping chorus live in liverpools climax comes with
 zimbo a retitled version of all my colours from the bands sophomore effort
 heaven up here this is one of the few songs thats actually significantly
 rearranged but the band nonetheless manages to capture the apocalyptic slow burn
 of the original
 
 admirably the band have chosen to include two versions of songs from 1983s
 trippy experimental porcupine which is widely regarded as their most
 difficult record its also one of their best the version of back of love is
 amazing bursting with postpunk fury and sergeants gravitydefying guitar
 playing the cutter though not quite as frantic reads similarly well as
 mccullochs vocals are at their best booming on the tense chorus and cutting
 straight through sergeants spastic outbursts with ease
 
 so in the end theres not a whole lot to complain about on this disc the
 performances are uniformly great the set list draws on a lot of their best
 material and the recording is crystal clear though occasionally theres a
 bit of hiss from the crowd microphone i suppose it would have been nicer
 if the album was all taken from a single performance the tracks are selected
 from two august 2001 shows at the liverpool institute for the performing arts
 paul mccartney auditorium as its nice to hear live recordings in the context
 of one complete show but thats a minor gripe the band manage a strong
 consistency of mood and performance acumen which is whats really important when
 youre listening at home
 
 suffice to say fans of echo and the bunnymen should check this out it will not
 disappoint as for neophytes i suppose it depends largely on how biased you are
 for or against live albums if youre an audiophile or an album person you may
 want to start with ocean rain or crocodiles but if youre just
 looking for a good overview of the bands career and some strong performances
 this could be the place either way live in liverpool is one of those
 rare live albums that keeps me coming back and theres a lot to be said for
 thathow the hell do you cover the wutang clan they form like voltron and im
 supposed to piece out this puzzle each mc has like three alternate personalities
 multiplying the angles of attack but iron flag gives me an approach its
 the most solid wu album in years i guess the clan wanted to slice through rumors
 that they were falling off because they holed up at the wu mansion and punched
 out twelve solid cuts first they feint with in the hood for once an intro
 thats listenable its rzas panoramic sweep from freestyle diss to jumpup
 anthem with brass blasting and glocks clicking in the background then the
 segue to rules which opens with ghostface killah just like on 36 chambers
 piano jabs keep a tight rhythm as he belts who the fuck knocked our buildings
 down who the man behind the world trade massacres step up now
 
 ghost gets his in but of course method man gets more taunting who yall kiddin
 tryin to act like my shoe fittin confused with your head up your ass like whos
 shittin still its weird to hear him up in the chorus asking how the fuck
 did we get so cool man we know it meth you dont gotta say it but its
 obvious the wu wanted the sharpest tongues in the front because hes all over
 iron flag as are ghost raekwon and a surprisingly onpoint inspecta deck
 on the opposite ol dirty bastards conspicuously absent doing time for crack
 possession and fleeing probation if anything the clans more cohesive without
 the presence of that chaotic god theyre all in together now on uzi pinky
 ring the prototype single where every head gets a verse
 
 the rzas clearly on to some oldschool flavor and its a lovely thing because it
 makes each song perfect for cruising theres horn samples lacing most tracks
 bringing an upbeat playful vibe despite the dirges rakeem knows how to have a
 good time chrome wheels drops these nasty mechanical squiggles that combine
 and interlock with bumping bass i thought id dread the day that divas came to
 the wu but madame d begs bang us in your cars bang us in your jeeps bang
 that shit retarded and its far from rb rapping bullshit per rza parlance
 even the tracks he farms out to wutang incorp affiliates thump hard one of
 these days rolls on funk guitars and a blunt beat courtesy of nick fury loftin
 the southernplayalistic cadillac music keeps ugod from ruining it when hes
 mumbling about being so unique and then wanting out of the clan 
 
 but ugod redeems with his verse on soul power where he sketches the best
 vignette crack a cocacola summer heat was my boredom dr j before jordan
 al green on the organ flavor flav provides the shoutout chorus and hes
 kidding around with meth at the end talking about family in long island
 lyrically the wu are much more earthy on iron flag maybe the
 thousanddollar lesbians werent catching many fans likewise theres about
 five percent of the five percent though gza of course drops his characteristic
 science you dont get much introspection just grandstanding like on yall
 been warned where rza digs you cant etchasketch all my rhyme threat try to
 bite my flow you catch ya throat step the only time they return to the
 languorous street noir of tracks like cream is on babies a grim
 raekwonghostface tale about a crooked cop
 
 the title track is the lone downtempo diversion the needle scratches and the
 synths blow like wind before the music descends into the glock a subsection
 with little more than a percussion loop rumbling and the clan gathered round
 shouting into the mic it comes across real cold but then dashing ends the
 album with deck singing nursery rhymes gza leaves behind a smooth verse james
 bondstyle before he disappears with all the catchy choruses each song on
 iron flag hits like another single to be released the kungfu samples
 are back masta killas still trying to carve out a name for himself and the wu
 prove they never need guests like snoop or isaac hayes to throw down a strong
 joint its an album about brotherhood fueled by the national war but no doubt
 sparked on a more personal level as method man deadpans on uzi give you the
 same advice that i gave my wife dont fuck with mine damnhow to say this yuji oniki sounds like the male version of natalie imbruglia
 now i realize thats a pretty strong thing to say about someone whom most people
 are unfamiliar with and because i still have some feeling left for struggling
 artists i thought twice about the comparison nevertheless the only other
 reason i can see not to compare oniki with the frail adult contemporary demon is
 that his production isnt quite as good also he doesnt seem to have her knack
 of sounding tortured and generally malnourished so hopefully hes got health
 on his side man this is not starting well
 
 oniki is based in oakland california most of the record was recorded at his
 house with a small band he then sent the tracks all over the place including
 to japan where katsui yuji of rovo added a little violin and sakanas nishiwaki
 added some guitar next stop for the tapes was cleveland where guided by voices
 doug gillard tacked on a couple of guitar solos furthermore beulahs bill swan
 blew his horn trumpet to flesh out some of the arrangements initially this
 seems to be a neat concept in making a solo record because the resulting sound
 should reflect more than just the idiosyncratic vision of the writer however in
 practice this is basically just oniki roping in his favorite session players
 which isnt that different from what say donald fagan does and whats so great
 about that
 
 other than the fact that im not terribly fond of the music oniki brings to mind
 the real issue is that im not all that fond of onikis music i will say that
 as a pop auteur he wrote produced and arranged all of the music on tvi
 he gets points for the understated some might say simple arrangements and
 overwhelmingly straightforward melodic tunes we may have seen the last days of
 pop artists who have protools at their fingertips and yet dont produce whackedout
 electronic pieces or aciddamaged beatles homages oniki certainly seems to be
 aiming for aor heaven here and i guess props are in order for him sticking to his
 guns so yeah
 
 some of the tunes are nice the opener 40 seconds is a good showcase for yujis
 sometimes nasal rarely very expressive but generally strong tenor it takes a
 lazy groove and adds a pinch of spacy reverb distant violin and some acoustic
 guitar making for a pleasant dreamy backdrop skeleton station is a short
 piano instrumental and a very nice accompaniment to staring out the window into
 the rain reminders is something of a torch song with a brooding chord
 progression and a relatively expansive arrangement mellotron strings soaring
 background vocals shimmering electric guitar that actually turns the tune into
 something like the younger cousin of blurs universal
 
 however the majority of music on tvi isnt that distinct the lowkey drama
 of one bright summer day with an energy level that stays constant approaching
 comatose for far too long the upbeat transport with its perky college beat
 and peppy badabop backing vocals threatens to dethrone the rembrandts as the
 kings of annoyingly passive pop between beds and clocks is almost as cute as
 imbruglia but then again onikis not a hot exsoap star so there shouldnt be
 any way he gets away with being this twee if light faintly emotional pop is
 your thing by all means check this record out i could see it appealing to the
 overstressed notimefornoise crowd but even then id take something tougher
 i hear kylie minogue is backornette coleman has followed a strange path most of the major figures in jazz spent their late teens and early 20s apprenticing with bands led by veterans eager to surround themselves with young players such as those run by art blakey dizzy gillespie horace silver and miles davis colemans early development as a soloist and composer on the other hand can only be a matter of speculation because colemans unusual ideas about music had difficulty finding in a foothold in the postbop jazz world of the midtolate 50s he had a late start with recording and so the first record he appeared on was one issued under his own name 1958s something else he was 28 at the timecolemans debut stands out in his discography not because of its quality but because the record features a piano coleman was a selftaught student of music who entered the arena with a beef against jazz he felt that chords exerted an undue influence over improvisation and limited a players expression striving to improvise with greater melodic freedom coleman ditched the piano for his second album tomorrow is the question signing with atlantic in 1959 coleman obtained a higher profile and generated controversy with releases including the shape of jazz to come and change of the century all leading up to the 1960 doublequartet release that coined a movement free jazzlook again at the titles of these early releases the shape of jazz to come change of the century free jazz one imagines coleman as a selfconfident visionary aware of his effect on the world of music the title of this recently reissued album provided a similar challenge to the populace this is our music coleman might have been saying are you going to listen originally released in 1960 the last quartet record before the free jazz session this is our music features coleman on alto don cherry on trumpet charlie haden on bass and ed blackwell on drums what amazes me about this era of coleman especially in light of the literature surrounding it is how accessible it is back in the day this band had the intelligentsia calling for coleman to be fitted for a straightjacket but to one weaned on the 60s impulse catalog the music sounds joyous pretty sensible and sanethe uptempo tracks here are teeming with life on blues connotation and folk tale the band sounds in the moment and brimming with ideas as if these four and fiveminute compositions are far too brief to ever contain them all the sporadic surges in tempo are early experiments in elastic time a trend that would be explored at great length as the 60s progressed and these bursts of energy make these pieces seem well bountiful also adding to the loose sense of fun on tracks like poise is the interplay between coleman and cherry at times they seem to be chasing each other around the tune while other moments find them doing a modern take on the callandresponse ensemble soling of dixieland despite the occasional rubbery rhythmic passage and playful tone all the faster pieces here swing in the fullest sense of the word with blackwell and hadens pulse set firmly in the traditionif the faster tracks on this is our music come across as buoyant and almost pop the more drawnout pieces are mysterious and pleasantly disorienting beauty is a rare thing is drifting and impressionistic with blackwells drums and hadens bowed bass used for color and shading instead of rhythm cherry and colemans lines are not concerned with melody or even pitch but manage to find expression in a series of squeaks groans and grunts the quartets take on the gershwin standard embraceable you the only track not composed by coleman and indeed the only standard he recorded during this period is necessarily more conventionally tuneful but it still moves with a peculiar gait the theme is familiar but blackwell uses mallets for the drums and barely touches the cymbals and both cherry and coleman take serious liberties with the melodywell never know what it was like to hear ornette coleman in 1959 and 1960 but theres an upside to encountering music stripped of its context we can just listen and not concern ourselves with determining which rules are being broken in 1960 people literally wanted to beat the crap out of ornette coleman because of what he was doing to jazz but now his work just sounds exceptionally fresh and timelesswashington in a stunning move reflecting yet another shift in our nations
 defense strategy the pentagon today unveiled plans to resuscitate a controversial
 weapons project that has been neglected for over a decade
 
 ladies and gentleman tomorrows battles will not be fought on the ground in the
 air or even under the water but will require entirely new military technology to
 be developed secretary of defense donald rumsfeld announced in a press conference
 this morning to defend ourselves from the increasingly powerful forces of
 terrorism worldwide we must turn to one of our countrys most valuable resources
 the supergroup
 
 the american supergroup arsenal has been steadily dwindling in power since the
 late 1960s when starstudded projects like csny and blind faith were used as
 a deterrent in the cold war with the soviet union further development of
 supergroup technology occurred during the reagan years focusing mainly upon the
 traveling wilburys agenda but recent reports have warned that these weapons lie
 mostly in a state of disrepair with the majority of their components dead fat
 andor balding as such the pentagon has started from scratch by introducing
 entirely new designs
 
 our first rollout in the new american supergroup program is the long winters
 said nick person director of supergroup strategy for the department of defense
 a project being developed at a confidential location somewhere in the northwestern
 united states many details of this operation are highly classified but ive
 been authorized to tell you it centers around singersongwriter john roderick
 and features members of the posies built to spill sunny day real estate
 fountains of wayne and death cab for cutie
 
 thomas zimmermann founder of the private organization citizen supergroup monitor
 notes that the announcement of the long winters reflects a profound shift in the
 militarys use of its supergroup resources recent attempts to develop new
 supergroup weaponry involved taking musicians from highprofile groups like the
 embarrassing failure of the phishprimuspolice hybrid oysterhead researchers
 found that placing three or more egotistical renowned musicians in a band
 creates a volatile mixture prone to excessive noodling and horrendously ineffective
 songwriting the long winters project by assembling its components from less
 popular but critically lauded bands indicates a new direction for the supergroup
 program
 
 an anonymous source from inside the pentagon confirmed this analysis when canada
 went public with the new pornographers last year it was a big embarrassment for
 the entire military wed always joked about canadas seemingly negligible
 supergroup capabilities laughing at the idea of the canucks combining bryan
 adams celine dion and the bassist from loverboy but when the canadians tapped
 into their surprisingly rich indie rock resources and released mass romantic
 we were all caught off guard
 
 meanwhile when pressed for information during a pitchfork interview death cabs
 ben gibbard refused to directly comment on rumors of his involvement in the long
 winters ive never met a lot of those people were not comrades or anything
 we dont play music together despite this denial inside sources have confirmed
 to this reporter that mr gibbard plays drums on the albums radioactively catchy
 carparts while bandmate chris walla lends his quirky production and keyboard
 skills throughout the album
the worst you can do is harm is the name of the debut release from the long
 winters and we feel it adequately reflects the considerable strengths of this
 new project mr person explained at todays press conference rooted in the
 traditional american countryrock style of wilco and clem snide developers have
 also added a glaze of poppy harmonies and synthesizer melodies with highly
 infectious songs like government loans and scent of lime the album has more
 than enough firepower to keep the axis of evil states in line
 
 however some skeptics temper the governments optimism about the long winters
 agenda the album most definitely has its flaws says mr zimmermann
 rodericks throaty nicotine vocals really wear thin over the course of ten
 tracks medicine cabinet pirate and unsalted butter are both good songs that
 run too long and well samaritan and copernicus are just flat out duds
 generally however its a strong first step for the revival of the supergroup
 program i cant get carparts out of my frickin head
 
 but zimmermann cautions technically the long winters are not so much a
 supergroup as a collection of rodericks songs recorded with the assistance of
 his luminous friends in the indie rock world by unconditionally labeling them a
 supergroup its as if the military were writing a highly conceptual overly clever
 record review and needed to fudge the details slightly to make an album fit the
 idea
 
 nevertheless the american supergroup program is once again a top priority of the
 pentagon searches of seized bunkers in afghanistan show preliminary indications
 that al qaeda has been developing their own supergroup purchasing guitarists and
 drummers on the black market from former soviet republics said person in
 response we are pursuing dan the automator for a highranking position in the
 supergroup developmental program and trying to arrange a resourcesharing
 coalition with england by 2003 we project a thom yorkedel tha funkee
 homosapienwill oldham assembly will be ready for deployment to armed forces
 stationed around the worldhiphop relies heavily on the foundation created by the dichotomy of repetition
 and novelty this takes many forms from the struggle of producers wishing to
 maintain a semblance of recognition for utilizing oldschool techniques to the
 desire of new mcs to push the boundaries of lyrical delivery recently this
 shifting between repetition and novelty has reached a manic pace to the point
 where it seems essential fare for a producer to shout over a track or reuse
 bass sounds and drum patterns to emphasize their signature in the advertising
 world its called branding
 
 the neptunes are the reigning kings of beatbranding throughout their bestknown
 tracks from superthug to southern hospitality some elements have remained
 more or less constant the bass sound a gritty ultimately recyclable sample
 and the offtime kicksnare combination that seemed revitalize hiphop for a
 minute but that minute has lasted two years and the same sounds now cross the
 board from britney spears to limp bizkit shit is getting ugly and nerd is
 the truest testament to this fact quoth the neptunes in search of seems
 like a bland title but for us its in search of love in search of happiness
 in search of smiling in search of that bitch with the big ass in search of the
 answer to why my brother smokes crack its all of that its about being open
in search of joins pharrell williams and chad hugo the neptunes with
 hometown friend shay that hometown incidentally is the same virginia area
 that brought up timbaland missy elliott and teddy riley this album conceivably
 brings the group back to their roots which in a letter written by pharrell on
 the groups website heavily emphasizes the acdc side of things
 
 the album has had a relatively tumultuous history especially over the last few
 months with a domestic release date pushed back by the neptunes decision to
 rerecord the album with the help of some live instrumentation over a year ago
 the original version of the album was released and garnered exactly no glowing
 reviews with the exception of a positive writeup in rolling stone
 whether or not this was the incentive for the group to rerecord is unclear
 the result however is an albums worth of hottodeath neptunes hooks and
 bass sounds tainted with the despicable addition of rapmetal drumming and
 distorted guitar posturing
 
 to backtrack a bit when the original album came out about a year ago the first
 single was the bet uncut videoworthy lapdance which promised to fulfill
 pharrells promised prophecies of hiphop as revolution via chorus lines like
 the politicians are lookin like to strippers to me see pharrell has been
 talking a lot of shit since the neptunes began to get some serious props stressing
 that doing a beat for jayz was a way of getting their message out to the masses
 
 but somewhere between i jus wanna luv u and pass the courvoisier signals got
 crossed pharrell chad and shay took the drum tracks off most of the album and
 added a drummer who could easily have cut his teeth in a slipknot cover band
 while rapmetal 101 drums bang away in the background the basslines are replaced
 by chugging guitar riffs reminiscent of your high school hardcore band what
 remains though is the exceptional quality of pharrells voice which unlike
 the bass sound doesnt lose its intensity due to repeated radio exposure the
 lyrics here are mostly decent too with the exception of brain which before
 it was rerecorded sounded clever and now sounds like a frat house anthem
 provider hints at the fact that were pharrell and chad born twelve years ago
 theyd be bumping this album along with kid rocks cocky
 
 one of the greatest benefits of being multimillion dollar producers is having
 access to recording equipment that will make your sounds even more superflawless
 this coupled with the neptunes five years of hitmaking experience make for a
 wellproduced album which generally doesnt mean shit to me chalk it up to
 an oversight on the part of nerd and their acronym speaks the truth and no
 one ever really dies maybe well get our hands on a third less compromised
 version of the album where the drummer has been fired and the guitar is being
 used to prop up the reconstituted drum machinessome albums have to be played a few times before theyre appreciated which is
 the polite way to say that upon first listen they sound unremarkable or even
 irritating the latest release by bloomington indianas brando single crown
 postcard provoked immediate dislike that slowly grew into a genuine respect
 this is a complicated album straightforward in small doses but hard to interpret
 as a whole
 
 start with the sound quality brando makes the most of their fourtrack recordings
 but maybe the format shouldnt be pushed this far home taping can be kind to
 straightup rock and solo bedroom confessional records but brandos arrangements
 are much more complicated the band parts are tight and precise with primary
 songwriter and performer derek richey layering lush sounds and synthesized string
 backdrops shoehorning all of this into a fourtrack can sound like taping music
 off the tv by holding a cassette recorder to the speaker the result is weak and
 distant when you want to hear it soar
 
 and theres richeys vocals hes a good singer on key confident and distinct
 but his high voice which resembles david sedaris is an acquired taste his
 delivery is so precise and his expression so unvaried that its hard to tell where
 hes coming from on the first track french algiers hes almost apologetic
 ive got more game than it appears he assures us but on other songs he
 sounds more bold and assertive bordering on snarky
 
 its after a couple of listens that the strength and diversity of the songwriting
 comes through single crown postcard is a mess of classic pop styles
 partisan echoes whimsical late60s britpop with its biting yet singsong
 lyrics by and by could have shown up on a dusty springfield album and richey
 forces some genuine soul out of his voice other songs borrow from more modern
 styles the piano line on driving to my desert could have come off the soundtrack
 to a hal hartley film and the great unwind cribs from every wistful indie pop
 song of the past ten years maybe sounding a little more sincere than average when
 you detect some rare vulnerability in richeys singing
 
 for as much as the songs are clean solid pop single crown postcard
 combines them into a hardtofathom package it shifts from somber to psychedelic
 from the pining of two views of your glass gloves to the oompaloompa gait and
 twinkly keyboards of two years a simpler album would be taken at face value
 but richey gives up so little of his intentions and opinions that he almost dares
 you to keep listening and digging in i dont know what the hell hes really
 singing about but its starting to sound pretty interestingwhat i get here gray skies hollow trees gallows poles night beasts along the
 moors bouts of depression lit afire with trance and trash can percussion not
 to mention more than an ounce of poetic pretense but of course when was emotional
 music supposed to deliver anything more weighty its very contagious and i can
 hope that was the intention truthfully i have no idea how or why this mysterious
 italian band made this music furthermore im not alone in this
 last year swans founder michael gira and young god records chief started getting
 odd packages from torino italy inside were cdrs of sounds compiled produced
 and otherwise emitted from a band of people known simply as larsen on his
 website gira describes the music therein as ranging from soft accordionbased
 abstractions to sometimes just a single sound or noise a scraping sound as if
 someone were slowly etching a piece of rusted metal with a blade of some sort
 the final package he received had nothing like that but rather a wad of cash a
 ticket to italy and a request for him to produce an album for larsen and as
 anyone with even a hint of adventure or sadism would gira accepted the
 invitation
 upon arriving gira was never actually permitted to see the members of larsen
 apparently he was relegated to the control room as the band behind a silk
 screen made music and when it fancied them communicated to gira via translators
 and other strangers he speaks of frequent heated violent arguments and
 watching the shadows from behind the cloth barrier as larsen played for hours
 on end before deciding it was time to actually start recording this is the
 introduction i had before me as i listened to rever and never let it be
 said that a bands lore cant be as much a factor in their music as the sounds
 they make
 now taken on its own this record doesnt possess quite as much of the macabre
 as its back story would indicate it does come awfully close though larsens
 sound has elements of damaged arty rock from all over i can hear lots of sonic
 youth conceptually even when it doesnt directly call to mind their music in
 the dreadfull repetitive figures and omnipresent guitar noise that isnt to
 say that larsen are necessarily noisy but a lot of the playing reminds me of
 similarly tense rock deconstructions by the american band there are also some
 hints of postrock though what i really want to say is that larsen doesnt mind
 taking a groove and running into the ground all in the name of lulling me into a
 damp sickly stupor gira calls them highly ritualized sounds and if that means
 theyre often uncomfortably numbing i agree
 the opener impro 2 features just such cyclical meandering it begins with an
 uptempo for larsen anyway march pattern featuring triangle accordion and
 lazily strummed clean electric guitar soon an unidentified male vocalist
 musicians include roberto maria clemente paolo dellapiana and sylvia grosso
 though no specific performance info is provided chants indecipherably sounding
 like a cross between a tibetan throat singer and a restrained death metal growler
 i would call this a mantra if not for the old recording of a trombone which comes
 in at the very end
 the epic radial follows and this is where larsen really lets its strengths
 shine thunderous reverberations act as fanfare and a distant accordion waxes
 the floor for the onslaught of distorted bass and guitar which has crept up so
 subtly as to make me wonder how things got so impenetrably loud all of a sudden
 someone begins to saw at a zither or some such piece of arcane craftsmanship in
 the background until about four minutes in when the rainstorm softens a bit
 the bass is still hacking away but slowly receding to reveal that the accordion
 from the beginning has in fact never stopped moaning the track is 11 minutes
 and larsen doesnt let on that this was just an introduction until the tune
 starts at the 5xbdminute mark at that point they rip into genuine fuzztrance
 gothpsych lets just say that its gloomier than this heat yet punchier than
 lateperiod swans
 the fairly brief mentre lightens the mood considerably and the fact that its
 in a major key tonality helps a ton and even manages to use the guttural growl
 of the male vocalist as a droning counterline to the spoken female narration
 finger number six tightens the rhythmic arrangement just sticks and a tom
 though retains the light electric guitar strum as an accompanying instrument for
 the ultraminimalist read two notes melody during their more experimental
 moments larsen might seem to fall into the psych camp with big echotreated
 atmospherics and dark acidpurified espousals from the unknown singers however
 the beat strategies presented on this tune and others like the aggressive
 akin often tighten the reins on the groups tendency to spill
 chiefly my issue with rever isnt that the band works up too much lather
 in their mud bath rather they only really seem to make one mess over and over
 fifty minutes of brooding pensive mood music might hit the spot for me on
 occasion though could be a bit tedious if im not up for it but at least as
 i write this its fairly impressive with any luck larsen may one day raise
 their black curtain to reveal something frighteningly goodwhat is it with musicians and madness why does rock lend itself so easily to the
 loons of course as ben watson has pointed out in a recent wire column
 theres a big difference between the mentally insane and the popular image of the
 rocker whos come unhinged its the velvet goldmine syndrome youre offered a
 thrilling sense of transgression but youre kept safe because its all objectified
 in the form of some garishlyclad star on stage lady stardust shows some leg
 jim morrison thinks dark thoughts about his mum youre fingering the ticket in
 your pocket and nodding along
 
 somewhere in that haze of drugs sex and glam lies marmoset yes theyre from
 indianapolis of all places and yes you will believe that in spite of it all
 when you hear this ep the living illusions reflects on late60s psychrock
 with lazy chords two or three at most and barebones drum backing an organ
 hums as guitarist dave jablonskis tenor insists im not right in the head i
 truly believe im not connected upstairs his other main number on the ep im
 always too late wanders as whimsically as any of syd barretts spacy old tunes
 the chorus begins in good nature but somehow in only three minutes the strums
 and singsong repetition add up to something almost unsettlingly obsessive
 
 i focused more on jorma whittaker marmosets bassist and other lead singer in
 my review of their 2001 album record in red a song by the same name
 appears here on the ep though not on that album and its a distillation of
 their entire lofi ethic drummer jason cavan sets a swaggering downbeat to the
 buzzy garagerock guitars and whittakers suddenly insinuating himself onto your
 lap with lines like i came to see you want to know who you are the guys
 always halfway between flirt and freakout as on the title track mishawaka is
 apparently a small town near south bend indiana and in the song of the same
 name whittakers driving alone towards it the truth is like a rattlesnake
 i hold it in my arms satisfy the charms he sings letting each syllable slip
 off his tongue and true to form the guitar slithers playfully just on the edge
 of tension
 
 what we have here is another twenty minutes of vintage marmoset a taste that will
 appeal across lines from britpoppers to nuggets collectors the ep is
 rounded out by a cover of the fourmosts 1963 hit im in love penned for them
 by john lennon and paul mccartney marmosets take on merseybeat is of course
 somewhat subdued but if anything it sounds even more genuine than the original
 then theres the instrumental soft evenings placed strangely as the first song
 its the longest just three minutes of the bass pulsing quietly and whittaker
 cooing strangely he sounds both serene and yet vulnerable and also quite mad
 
 soft evenings clearly rose from a jam which sparks a thought maybe that freeform
 mindstate that gets equated with insanity finds itself easily in music because
 of the immediacy of the connection its like painting where you can slather
 oil directly on canvas whereas other forms like film require preparation
 writing is an interesting middle ground because you can definitely scratch down
 whatever comes to mind but in practice id guess there are more boredoms
 listeners than readers of burroughs cutups still you did read this review
 didnt youof all the complaints levied by vinyl purists the only one ive ever really given
 much credence to is the fact that compact discs essentially suck as artifacts a
 limitedpressing seveninch a dusty old slab of vinyl these are the kind of
 relics that can be treasured for ages and can provide that sorely missed goofy
 fanboy sense of connection with an artist cds on the other hand reek of mass
 production not only is the packaging all secured behind flimsy plastic but the
 music itself can be reproduced infinitely without any change in quality though
 its handy bitesized and generally convenient a cd generally doesnt leave you
 with the sense that its a precious artifact a gift straight from the artist to
 you to be appreciated for years to come
 
 but will cullen hart along with a number of other experimental weirdos like
 jackieo motherfucker and acid mothers temple aims to change all that with the
 olivia tremor control harts wonderful artwork helped make each of that bands
 releases feel like something worth admiring as well as setting the mood for the
 records themselves now with cloud recordings homemade project hart is releasing
 beautifully packaged cdrs all made with decidedly analog implements such as
 spray paint and tracing paper every cloud homemade release is unique each has
 its own slightly varying artwork made lovingly by hart himself and his athens
 cohorts
 
 musically the homemades are similarly intimate smaller projects that would
 appeal to people who are particularly in tune with harts musical sensibility
 inside views one in the first series of cdrs to be released is a
 revisitation of the circulatory systems excellent selftitled debut record
 whereas circulatory system was in many ways the most straightforward
 album to be released by hart yet inside views takes the tracks from that
 album on a black foliagestyle ride complete with sound collages and
 abrupt song changes
circulatory system had nearly infinite sonic material to mine with some
 songs from that album containing upwards of 60 simultaneous tracks and countless
 additional tracks not having made it onto the final mix an almost entirely
 different record could have been assembled from source material inside views
 makes it clear however that harts intention wasnt to create something entirely
 new but rather to provide alternate sonic perspectives on an incredibly complex
 record
 
 over its thirteen untitled tracks inside views covers many of the best
 songs from circulatory system its first track is a sparser interpretation
 of yesterdays world with a slithery guitar line taking the forefront and a
 more subdued rhythm this less structured rendering allows hart to introduce a
 whole new slew of weird trippy sounds and little cutup edits of the song
 elsewhere hart pulls out to focus on some of the most compelling sounds on
 circulatory system individually the deep chanting of ancient voices on
 outside blasts being the most notable example
 
 around the tenth track inside views becomes deeply sparse and ambient
 providing an interesting change of pace from the oftbreakneck sonic exploration
 that precedes it this period of quiet segues into a skeletal interpretation of
 inside blasts perhaps the best track on circulatory system the whirling
 background drones that were once pushed way back in the mix are audible now and
 make a prime case for harts talent as a creator of incredible unusual sounds
 
 ultimately inside views succeeds wonderfully in providing some new vistas
 on a brilliant record by abruptly picking you up in the middle of one song and
 dropping you down in another hart shows just how successful he was in creating a
 whole variety of strange environments on circulatory system as a standalone
 effort inside views is far from stacking up against the body of harts
 other work but as a handmade companion piece to one of last years most memorable
 albums its something to treasureat the end of the day perhaps it comes down to the argument of escapism versus
 elitism its been so long since prog was a popular genre that the argument over
 its relevance has seemingly been left by the wayside however there are several
 attitudes we take for granted today that may never have existed outside of the
 general popcritic population but seem to have been perpetuated over the past
 thirty years to the point of being distorted and disproportionately trusted
 ultimately that there is a humbly active prog scene today check the cults of
 oddly named groups such as spocks beard or the flower kings if youre in doubt
 might be the funniest anticlimax in rock allow me to shoot down some
 stereotypes
prog is pretentious and bloated
 
 yes and emerson lake and palmer are often cited as the prime examples while i
 cant defend a couple of those later 70s yes albums and the insane clown affair
 that is pictures at an exhibition i will say that at their worst these
 bands never approached the bombast of the slightest sex pistols or stooges album
only dungeons dragons nerds listen to prog
 
 this idea may stem from progs oftenwhimsical subject matter or mythical album
 covers though i have to say that ive never heard a prog tune about the king of
 carrot flowers
prog doesnt rock
 
 
 
 despite the superficiality of these kinds of criticisms many of the original
 bands took them to heart and by 1977 or so most of them had receded into crass
 commercialism or were forced out of the music business entirely due to changing
 trends the ones that lived on were generally one of two ilks the first was
 the style chameleon yes and genesis are the two most famous examples with the
 latter band going so far as to allow their frontman to lead them into the worst
 regions of mor banality the second type was the far more interesting proposition
 bands that graduated from prog into even stranger realms henry cow was this type
 of band and what follows may change your perception of prog forever
 
 henry cow was founded at cambridge university england by guitarist fred frith and
 keyboardistreed player tim hodgkinson percussionist chris cutler joined in 1971
 by which time the band had settled into a regular unit a diverse mix of influences
 zappa modern classical composition free jazz etc along with the natural
 creativity and intelligence of the group members most had finished their college
 degrees before leg end was released in 1973 spawned a sound unlike any
 contemporary prog band they were one of virgin records first acts and made
 their first tour with relative superstars faust and would later tour with
 captain beefheart all of this during the heyday of symphonic prog bands like
 yes and genesis
 
 henry cows sound always seemed to me a direct response to what was popularly
 passing as experimental music during their time where a band like gentle giant
 one of the more compositionally complex prog bands would take classical
 counterpoint and color it with rock groove and volume the cow would remove color
 altogether opting for sheer intensity through concept often manifested in
 marxist political statements and relentlessly dry arrangements it wasnt
 enough that their tunes sounded like boisterous schoenberg etudes but they
 usually featured chamber classical instruments such as oboe bassoon clarinet
 and violin and where a typical prog band would have used this to evoke the
 romanticism of composers like brahms or strauss cow laid all their cards on the
 table by naming themselves after the experimental american composer henry cowell
 they seemed very intent on opposing cutler would later even initiate the musical
 collective rock in opposition any stereotype one might throw at them
 
 i must admit this has always colored my perception of the band if yes were the
 double coconutfudge of rock perhaps best for escapist fantasies then henry cow
 were certainly wheat germ its not that they werent cool in their way but
 theres a notsosubtle academic aftertaste to much of their music for me
 western culture was their final record and is probably the most overtly
 influenced by modern classical composition its not very hard to hear why this
 music is important in the sense that it lays the groundwork for a whole school
 of avantrock and prog that doesnt cause cavities my caveat would be one of
 aesthetics because if youre looking for a party youd best dig out long
 distance runaround instead
 
 by the time western culture was released in 1979 the group was mostly
 separated cutler and frith would soon form the excellent art bears with dagmar
 krause who had performed with cow during several occasions and hodgkinson and
 reedist lindsay cooper wrote the pieces on this album exclusively industry
 begins things with a brainfreeze as the opening organ screech gives way to
 dissonant guitar and hacking drums hyperrhythmic figures but certainly not
 beats accentuated by stinging guitar and angular violin lines suggest quite
 well whatever inhuman technological madness the title implies there are no
 vocals anywhere on the album so the difficult melodies rely on the arrangers
 skill with voicing in order to stand out now if all of this sounds a bit
 technical rest assured thats probably appropriate
 
 the decay of cities brings in familiar sonorities with friths rather gorgeous
 acoustic guitar exposition all of the players were unsung in the grand scheme
 of prog though frith was arguably the most important element for this group if
 only because he brought a much needed touch of the real world to the music
 after the intro an ominous trombone and piano duet ensues and frith reenters
 with guitar figures at once asian and cageian there are some very clever things
 happening here with kinetic trading of figures by percussion guitar piano and
 winds later on saxophone carries the tune sounding like a cross between an
 intense somber jazz balladeer and flighty postornette bopper
 
 coopers first piece falling away opens with a chorus of woodwinds similar
 to some of zappas classicaljazz fusion experiments of the early 70s this
 reference is short lived as the band bangs through with drums and a mad ostinato
 line that reminds me of their belgian brethren univers zero another classically
 minded band who were somehow even more deadly serious than the cow this leads
 to some of the most intense stuff on the record as themes fly by at breakneck
 pace while cutler never stops pounding his kit and still never actually playing
 beats coretels tale is more of the same with enhanced moodiness via creepy
 flutes and some nicely cecil tayloresque piano playing
 
 the original western culture closes with 12 the sky though the reissue
 includes three more tunes including a tribute to one of cutlers favorites pere
 ubu still no rest for weary ears though i must say that ive always been
 impressed at henry cows purity of vision whatever you want to say of prog
 even on the experimental end bands that remain true to their original spirit are
 rare enough that i respect these musicians based merely on principal of course
 all of the individuals involved here would go on to very interesting careers in
 any number of odd settings and i would be remiss if i didnt point out that even
 twenty years later they are more interesting than the majority of current
 experimental rock groups so theyre not as entertaining or as easy to poke fun
 at as yes or as cool to name drop as can or faust but henry cow were as original
 an act as ever played rock and will probably continue to challenge listeners
 for as long as their work remains availablejamaican dub music reflects itself as a subsonic blast a thunderclap its a
 community of musicians popularly known to be directed by a twoheaded beast the
 madman and the sober prophet lee scratch perry and osbourne king tubby ruddock
 digital music is shunned as artificial by fetishists these fetishists are
 nothing more than pallid traditionalists is the secret message delivered by these
 15 tracks a message encoded in bass
 
 this compilation comes at a terribly appropriate time the collective consciousness
 of the electronic music scene has advanced to a point where they can finally
 recognize the contribution of reggae music to their own production techniques
 these producers are looking for something else a now thing
 
 the artists represented on this collection come forth as serious innovators of
 the dub music style theyve managed to incorporate the heaviest aspects of dance
 music into crashing anthems and psychedout battle cries it seems almost
 impossible listening to these tracks that this kind of music could be released
 in this day and age without anyone knowing about it the joy of hearing something
 new is accompanied by a sense that youre getting a gift
 
 z2010 by lenky
 impresses such a sense of urgency on the listener with its distorted melodies and
 a vocoded voice chanting madness madness madness throughout the length
 of the song its easy to imagine the type of scene that could accompany this
 music which sounds like timbaland creating propaganda music for the government
 similarly grass cyaat by richard browne has a repetitive chant of fever
 which has an even closer apparent relationship to hiphop music thumping with
 spedup synthlines and sloweddown bass jigga by slam productions samples
 jayzs rendition of scarface ok these affirmations are beautiful reminders
 of the grinding desire by these producers to move people physically
 
 the organ and synthesizer sounds pervasive on these songs demonstrate the amazing
 ability of present technology to effectively reference tone and melody in an
 interesting manner these artists like steely cleevie fucking kill it on
 nightcrawler a death walk track with a shouted hey and unintelligible echoing
 garbles bassheavy and menacing the synth sounds evoke high danger
 
 the connections to the original holy dub music which brought this all about is
 apparent throughout the song selections the rhythms are constant reminders of
 the genres roots now thing is perry and tubby through a digital guise
 a literal transformation of time the beauty of the music lies in the intersections
 between its stark originality in beat construction and precise melodic and bass
 constructions and its ability to properly reference its nascence in jamaican ska
 and reggae perhaps its the inability of most contemporary producers to properly
 achieve the latter in any event this document will prove influential to all
 those who hear it
 
 may the gospel of the now thing be spread amongst all willing participants
 the tools are all present and reliable vocoders reverb echo bass drums and
 uncompromising rhythm do not let these cries go unhearddear josh
 
 remember the first time we met on that cloudy afternoon in the high school
 parking lot you brushed up against me as you unlocked the door of your car
 and i noticed your shy smile and your pedro the lion tshirt i said hi
 
 and you said theres a sharp december hush in the clearing where she kneels
 frost upon the ground shoes worn in the heel this could be paradise
 
 i shivered and said oh wow is that braid
 
 you sighed no thats the atari star
 
 ill never forget the way our hands touched when you gave me the cd it had this
 really pretty leaf drawing on the cover and it was titled and other smaller
 brighter worlds which is so beautiful and internal and intense your eyes
 lit up like soft september musing and you said its your new favorite band
 
 later that night when we met on instant messenger i plied you for more
 information you told me that the atari star was on a record label called johanns
 face that put out a lot of bands you used to listen to back when you were sort of
 a punk rocker and theres a close label association with the alkaline trio which
 is one of my favorite bands and you said marc ruvolo lead singerguitarist for
 the atari star is a coowner of johanns face records
 
 and i was so excited to hear the cd because most bands that have atari in the
 name are good except that one thats sort of goth you told me to listen to track
 four occasional genius and everyday polite terror i did and i heard these
 beautiful arpeggios of a keyboard on glockenspiel setting and these repetitive
 but totally sincere guitar lines and i thought for a minute it sounded like
 elevator music but that was cool because it also sounded a little bit like that
 band spandau ballet but not quite so good then this sweet sort of offkey
 voice comes in singing i cross my fingers your look of sadness melts away
 and i teared a little josh for real especially when he sang you will become
 the things you say but stay with me tonight
 
 the whole cd was that good even on capricorn when the keyboard in the opening
 line sounds a lot like jaws but slower i guess thats unintentional because
 these guys totally know how to rock the keyboard so much so that i went up to the
 attic and pulled out my old casio and you know what i could play most of the
 songs after a couple hours
 
 not all the songs were slow and sad either some of them like black licorice
 and gas fumes were uptempo and dancy like my favorite songs on old promise ring
 records theres this piano part that mom says sounds kind of like neil diamond
 or maybe billy joel and hands was just an instrumental with vacant white noise
 and disconnected voices which sounds like a sonic interpretation of my totally
 hardcore ennui
 
 on our first date we went to the vegetarian restaurant next door to barnes and
 noble and after dinner we hooked up in your car to the sound of ordinary clock
 you wept when the keyboards crescendoed in those pretty childlike chords at the
 line she whispered to me unselfconsciously she whispered to me with gravity
 that this too shall pass and then you tried to take off my bra
 
 it was like that for two weeks then my sister came home from college i dragged
 her up to my room this is my favorite band i said
 
 i proudly played all our favorite songs but halfway through the third she stood
 abruptly holding her ears and said lindsay this sounds like my ninth grade
 overenunciating tone deaf actor exboyfriend singing his own poetry and
 playing a casio keyboard at a karaoke bar on 80s night the only song that sort of
 works for me is hands accidentally touch which is fairly benign quiet and
 pretty even if the lyrics are silly and the keyboards are cheesy your
 boyfriend turned you onto this
 
 i was so embarrassed josh because the more i thought about it she was right
 the cd was pretty bad but not even bad in a funny way bad in a depressing
 pathetic spineless sort of way and thats not sexy its not even very appealing
 if you think about it kinda like how youd get all sensitive and emotional right
 before you tried to take off my underwear that wasnt a coincidence was it
 
 so im dumping you for a strokes fan i met on makeoutclubcom his name is jeremy
 he smokes and he doesnt like atari star thats all you really need to know
 
 and so what better way to end than with a line from our song hands accidentally
 touch the same line you wrote in the fog on my window when we were making out
 in the car last week i fix this image and then file it away hands that touch
 linger briefly then withdraw landslides of silence touch the ether
 
 what the fuck does that mean anywayin the forward to his book escape from reason the noted christian
 philosopherapologist francis schaeffer wrote that every generation of christian
 has the problem of learning how to speak meaningfully to its own age soul junk
 is glen galaxys means of solving this problem
 
 galaxy aka glen galloway formed soul junk in 1994 when his band trumans water
 relocated to portland he stayed behind in san diego although he does still
 sit in with the band on occasion anyone familiar with the freewheeling
 experimentalism of trumans water will hear it echoed in the music of soul junk
 as theres a similar sense that anything might happen at any moment there is one
 notable distinction however a good percentage of soul junks lyrics especially
 on the earlier releases are drawn from the bible verbatim
 
 that probably bothers a lot of people and frankly it bothers me a little bit too
 but ive come to realize that maybe to be bothered is exactly the point or at
 least one of the points maybe its supposed to shock us hearing those words
 and stories in these various musical contexts into reevaluating them
 
 imagine a coarservoiced bornagain steve malkmus and youve got a bead on mr
 galaxys style a musical polymath conversant in all genres without sounding
 contrived or at times sounding so knowingly contrived as to be a selfreflexive
 comment upon itself at times galaxy seems so drenched in irony that he comes
 full circle to being sincere again
 
 as for this 6song 23minute ep its straightup solid the beckmeetsmadlib
 brand of hiphop that permeated the last soul junk fulllength is here replaced
 with a frantic spazzedout kind of indie rock and shambling folkpop synths
 banjo trumpet and anything else found around the studio gets thrown in creating
 the feeling of some sort of strange postmodern hootenanny
 
 it probably goes a long way toward explaining what this record sounds like to say
 that a few members of the danielson famile lend their skills including daniel
 smith who also recorded and produced the ep the loose freeflowing vibe is best
 captured on the bright epending miniepic good as dead on which galaxy
 strains his vocal chords to the limit howling i will speak to you and as he
 spoke his spirit came into me as organ swirls in the background
 
 but if you just want to know whether or not an adventurouslistening nonchristian
 could get into this id say like with the danielson famile the odds are
 probably better than those of your average jesus freakcall me oldfashioned but im a big fan of traditional english i dont mean
 shakespearean middle english or even the formal english used in legal documents
 and treaties im talking about simple syntax and spelling and at the very
 least some sort of shadow of grammar of course im not perfect myself i use
 sentence fragments all the time in my own reviews but i usually try anyway
 
 i guess its just a byproduct of our age and imperfect educational system that a
 lot of people simply dont write very well people either havent learned how to
 write correctly or just dont take the time to check themselves i get dozens
 of emails each week that dont even begin to resemble popularly accepted
 grammatical structures hell just look at the angriest responses in our reader
 mail section for a veritable museum of mangled usage
 
 all of this fogeyish complaining stems from reading the title of this album the
 debut from the capitol years confession it doesnt make a damn bit of
 difference whether or not this guy spells the title of his album meet your
 acres or meet yr acres but ill be honest and say that it just bugs
 the crap out of me i lay the blame for all this sansvowel spelling of your
 on sonic youth who probably werent the first to use it but definitely helped
 popularized it in the underground during the 80s lest i waste any more of your
 time with my obsessive rambling though lets have a look at the record
 
 first lets mention that the capitol years isnt a band rather its a
 philadelphia man who calls himself shai son of eli you can make your own
 judgment about that he variously gives himself credit for each of the instruments
 heard on the record placing his name several times over a series of photos of
 adorable horses its actually pretty endearing shai also shares recording and
 mixing credits with thom monahan of pernice brothers fame which gives him something
 close to autocratic control over the making of the entire record
 
 of course it takes a remarkable brand of artist to make a truly great recording
 with little to no outside aid and lets just say that shai isnt quite there yet
 based on the evidence presented here he may get there someday soon but all this
 album shows is a promising talent still in its infancy shai and monahan have
 managed to make the album sound excellent and the songs flow together pretty
 well on the whole
 
 the meat of any rock record has to be in the songs though and while it all
 may sound great most of the songs shai has cooked up here arent really that
 amazing though not for lack of trying songs like may and sitar fixer
 develop unexpectedly away from their basic rock premises into more dissonant
 territory while faces and beer is a highlight with its waltz beat and cleanly
 strummed guitars faces and beer contains one of the albums best melodies
 and shai delivers it ably harmonizing with himself and keeping the feel laid
 back its nice but the problem is that it doesnt really go much of anywhere
 its verse after verse after verse and it doesnt have a strong enough chorus
 to justify the lack of other sections
 
 siamese suns is somewhat similar in structure but includes an acoustic guitar
 part that nicely answers the understated verse melody its actually somewhat
 close to elliott smiths kill rock stars output with a quiet grace that suits
 shai as a performer quite well rolling hills follows with a similarly pastoral
 vibe though its locked into a more standard rock groove the processed vocals
 in the chorus which consists solely of the lyric come on come down resembles
 mark linkous playing it straight while the massed shais that echo the line in
 the background sort of sound like they wandered off from mott the hooples all
 the young dudes sessions
 
 the albums folkinflected midsection is definitely its best swath and the other
 sections that surround it are plagued by a kind of facelessness that keep them
 from sticking rollers row opens things with offkilter harmonies and a
 restrained rock feel that sort of resembles the shazam with a lot less personality
 while here comes makes employ of that distorted sparklehorse vocal sound to
 little effect its the kind of thing that could be great if the writing were
 more consistently memorable the harmonica solo at the end adds a good texture
 but nothing substantial musically
 
 then theres the aforementioned sitar fixer which begins over strummed acoustic
 guitar with a repetitive melody before a tuneless heavily distorted guitar invades
 things and the drums come way up in the mix playing a disjointed beat its
 unexpected and even kind of interesting but it doesnt seem to serve much of a
 purpose the song doesnt build to its ending naturally and once the dissonant
 section does arrive its not developed beyond a short repeated passage
 
 on the other end of the album whats yr problem is a fairly inconsequential
 instrumental featuring layered guitars over a programmed beat it functions well
 as a textural exercise but as a piece of music its aimless this brings us to
 the closer a faithfully rendered cover of the velvet undergrounds all tomorrows
 parties it feels considerably folkier in his hands given that he uses
 predominantly acoustic instrumentation and even if he cant spell your his
 pronunciation is certainly better than nicos all in all though the version is
 pleasant without adding anything to the original or making any attempt to
 reinterpret it
 
 so there you have it meet yr acres shows a young artist with a ton of
 potential doing what young artists with a ton of potential often do making a
 spotty but competent debut album obnoxious spellings aside there arent many
 glaring faults to be found with the capitol years sound just some areas that
 could use improvement heres hoping the next record lives up to its potential
 and maybe works on its spelling a bitlook i know youre thinking about buying that new airport 5 record you saw it
 at the record store the other day and it has that glossy sticker on the front
 airport 5 is robert pollard and tobin sprout the packaging even looks pretty
 cool its got that distressed typewriter font like on the under the bushesera
 singles and that enigmatic jason piercestyle collage on the cover
 
 but i hope that doesnt mean youre assuming it sounds like under the
 bushes too pollard and sprout wrote some incredible songs together i mean
 14 cheerleader coldfront hot freaks guided by voices discography isnt
 exactly known for its consistency but sometimes pollard hits when you least
 expect him to after mag earwhig i was about to throw in the towel but
 the kickass lofi record they cut oldschool afterwards tonics and twisted
 chasers made me believe again optional bases opposed the top chicks
 silver chord that records their bestkept secret man it was the first album
 to really recapture the living room magic of bee thousand rather than the
 band aesthetic they aimed for on alien lanes and under the bushes
 
 so last year when i read that pollard and sprout were collaborating again on a
 tonics ii i mean thats got to totally kick ass right i preordered
 it from fading captain the first day then it came like a couple of months later
 airport 5 tower in the fountain of sparks and it wasnt their best
 work but it sure sounded great theres no mistaking sprouts bright trebly
 guitars and cheapo drum machines beneath pollards marlboroenhanced growl and
 there were some nice hooks here and there stifled man casino was pretty catchy
 and circle of trim was prime gbv
 
 so i got the new one life starts here and its pretty much the same deal
 pollards lyrics and vocals over instrumental beds provided by sprout its the
 formula pollards been mining since waved out recording the instruments
 at home in his spare time with friends then knocking out the vocals and mixes
 in a couple of days in a real studio with a proper engineer only now he doesnt
 write or play the music he just has friends like sprout or superchunks mac
 mccaughan send him instrumentals and sings over them karaokestyle so theres
 no real opportunity for interaction you know theres no retaking the songs
 no adding a bridge here or taking a few bars off the chorus there
 
 my biggest complaint about guided by voices has always been that theres a
 builtin disposability to the songs that leaves the listener always craving
 something more something better thats so sweet how youre not an airplane
 just ends the album like that play it again if motor away had just been
 recorded better i know it could have been a major radio hit i cant believe
 they left shrine to the dynamic years off do the collapse etc their
 live shows are the same way thats so cool that they just played cutout witch
 and echos myron but when are they gonna play peephole and so it goes
 with airport 5
 
 yellow wife no 5 and i cant freeze anymore coast along on generic sprout
 bass grooves with nothing particularly offensive or exciting to stand out
 were in the business steals shamelessly from sprouts back catalog essentially
 a sloweddown doa retread of beast of souls with embarrassingly offkey delivery
 from the fadin captain the attempts at variety in the instrumentation im
 thinking about the fauxhorsetrot percussion on however young they are and the
 tinny synths on out in the world do nothing but hamhandedly disguise more
 of the same ol same ol the interminable pretentious epic wrong drama
 addiction and unlistenable spokenword fragment the dawntrust guarantee kick
 it up a notch in the canons of awful selfindulgence surely pollard as a
 former schoolteacher must once have told a kid you are capable of better than
 this
 
 great music is about how it makes the listener feel not about who appears in the
 credits albums like life starts here are about as exciting as a contractual
 obligation and make a mockery of good solid songwriting and recording it is
 to be blunt a waste of both the performers and the listeners timethere is a certain comfort to be found in habit my father recognized this while
 yet a young man it took me much longer to recognize the same with regards to him
 for years i attempted to give harlan imaginative heartfelt christmas and birthday
 presents only to be dismayed when i would find said presents months later resting
 atop bookshelves uncracked or in the bottoms of a cardboard boxes prepared for
 storage all harlan ever asked for was vneck tshirts oldman boxers and the
 occasional pair of khaki slacks it took me over 20 years to finally acquiesce
 in this boxers and slacks philanthropy
 
 to some degree we all prefer the familiar this explains the stateside failure
 of the metric system and to a lesser extent vegemite like they say if it
 aint broke dont fix it i feel the same way about womens hair for example
 what heterosexual male has not been forced to answer this question honey how
 do you like my new haircut for your information the correct answer is always
 i love it you look like bo derek the largenutted boyfriend however would
 reject appeasement and instead offer the following rejoinder you mean the one
 that makes you look like billie jean king what the fuck were you thinking
 
 if damien jurados music were my girlfriend i just might grow nuts and drop that
 bomb the folkpop of jurados prior three releases was honest introspective
 moody sometimes peppy and sometimes heartbreaking the new jurado is none of
 those things it is the longhaired girlfriend who gets mowed by fantastic sams
 produced by pedro the lions david bazan i break chairs consistently
 presents a more direct aggressive rock tenor that is very surprising and for a
 fan like myself a bit disappointing
 
 not disappointing at all however is the first track on i break chairs
 paperwings the rollicking poprock number has a gritty footstomping edge to
 it and a powerful chorus built around descending overdriven bar chords replete
 with jurado yelping a high note way beyond his range the tunes on the rest of
 the disc are recognizably jurado with sparse lyricism and damiens characteristic
 melodic tools like the guitar tracking the vocal melody as on inevitable and
 air show disaster orchestration is simple and direct with guitars at the
 forefront and bass and drums locked and solid jurados voice lends a folksy
 country timbre to the mix another high moment comes on the instrumental denouement
 of never ending tide which balances a background of controlled feedback and
 drum machine with a wistful reverbed guitar riff like titanic blends poprock
 damien with shades of the sweet quaint and thoughtful damien of earlier years
 its sappy but rewarding
 
 by the end of the record though the songs begin to blend together some even
 seem to blend into other albums like lose my head which i swear ive heard
 before jurado was aiming for thematic consistency with the disc he wanted a
 rock record and thats what he recorded stylistically however theres little
 room for error when writing poprock songs especially those with a creative
 approach as generic as this collection without a recognizable hook theres very
 little to set a song apart so songs like big deal the way you look and
 castles just seem to take up space theyre well executed with plenty of sonic
 punch they just lack that certain je ne sai quoi that digs itself into your
 subconscious
 
 when you learn to love something the word change is inherently bad it inspires
 a reflexive hatred regardless of the merits of the change so maybe i break
 chairs was doomed from the start but like shorthaired women ive warmed up
 a little to the newlook jurado its not half bad its solidly executed and
 very consistent there arent any obvious weak spots and there are a few peaks
 but in the final analysis i yearn for the damien of old he just did what he did
 the melancholy stuff in particular better than anybody else to use the 911
 vernacular a return to normalcy would be welcome lets just hope damiens got
 a little harlan in himim too cheap to get hbo every time a new season of the sopranos comes on i
 wait for some friend to tape it and then i borrow the whole thing all thirteen
 hours and watch it in one or maybe two sittings but later if i go back and
 watch just one of the episodes its a different experience every season is driven
 by a few main arcs but watching it piece by piece you can focus on the smaller
 stories and subtle structures that you miss when you plow through the whole thing
 each episode both gains and loses something when its jammed in with the others
 
 fred friths suite freedom in fragments written for and performed here by
 the rova saxophone quartet explores the same idea the relationship between the
 parts and the whole he says in the liner notes that he wanted to write compositions
 which could reach their narrative potential by a force of accumulation small
 stories that when heard together become big stories each of the twentythree
 sections of the suite has narrative qualities a feeling of drama tension or of
 action unfolding which reinforce each other when the sections are taken together
 
 take the third piece song and dance the song bolts out with an anticipatory
 pulsing rhythm under a soprano sax solo by bruce ackley it transitions to a
 whirling folk song as steve adams steps up on alto before changing again to a
 driving but mournful finale behind larry ochs tenor this is a strong and
 exciting piece by itself but placed between the fanfare of advertising and the
 probing introduction of void where prohibited it acquires a sense of drama
 its establishing a scene or introducing a story
 
 at the other end of the record the conflicts and tensions throughout the suite
 culminate in chained to the skyway an ominous song that breaks into rapid
 angry firing theres some kind of a fight going on that barely gets patched up
 on the next track batteries not includednostalgia where raskins baritone
 stumbles in to make a guttural statement and the others quietly join him the
 closer freedom is your friends ii sounds bleak and wailing and if theres
 any complaint you can make about the piece as a narrative its that the conflict
 and woe prevail without much of a catharsis tony soprano may never escape his
 emotional struggle but at least he gets to whack people
 
 though freedom in fragments forms a loose story arc this is just one
 configuration of the work frith intended to keep it abstract and open none of
 the compositions implies a specific story or theme and further theyre written
 to be played in any order some arrangements work better than others but theres
 no definitive sequence freedom in fragments was commissioned in 1994 by
 rova leading interpreters of new music who perform works that rely heavily on
 improvisation their experience with this piece its still in their repertoire
 today shows in how well they interpret this flexible music
 
 the suites greatest strength is the way it lets rova crawl around their instruments
 from the melodic ballads to noisy skronk the sax quartet is a powerful format
 and for as little as its been adopted groups like rova and the world saxophone
 quartet have demonstrated the awesome harmonies and pulsing rhythms that a small
 allsax ensemble can produce freedom in fragments is a great workout from
 ikues song a curious oneminute duet the smooth and elegant water under the
 bridge which has the richest melody or t square park lark a tenminute piece
 that acts as its own epic with rova shifting seamlessly into group improvisation
 each member of rova is a capable soloist but its the ensemble sections that are
 really impressive their growth over two decades together is undeniable
 
 tzadik has done a typically great job of recognizing and recording an undervalued
 piece of music however this time they made a critical mistake probably to make
 a good listening experience the album only includes sixteen of the twentythree
 pieces in the suite a few sections have been recorded before but this will
 probably be the only major release and a different specialty label would have
 thrown in every single measure and every scrap of music if tzadik had included
 the other sections as bonus tracks or included another disc with an alternate
 sequence this would be a definitive release but as it stands its a great
 record of a fascinating worksigh the middle of the road it seems like i find myself here a lot when writing
 reviews sometimes id rather get one of the pieces of trash from the gutter to
 review than yet another 5070 disc see the thing is listening to these albums
 over and over again isnt really a chore or anything but its the thought that
 im probably not coming back to them any time soon that makes it feel kind of
 futile plus i just got an outofprint long fin killie album that ive been
 wanting to hear for ages in the mail and this is keeping me from getting to it
 
 ah but the show must go on for without reviews of all albums great and terrible
 and everything that falls in between pitchfork would not exist and we couldnt
 have that now could we no of course not on with it then
 
 todays little slab of pavement comes courtesy of josh rouse a young
 singersongwriter with two albums and a collaborative ep with lambchops kurt
 wagner under his belt and apparently a lot more where that came from let
 me be forthright under cold blue stars is a rather appropriately titled
 effort that some will delight in and many more will scarcely offer a second thought
 to its by no means a bad record and there are even several things about it
 that make it outstanding but there are just not enough of those things to make
 it a truly exceptional album
 
 the biggest problem with this album for me is rouse himself not his writing or
 his composition but his voice by and large rouses vocals come off like a
 less tuneful more crackprone ryan adams though to be fair its the old
 obviously sincere ryan adams hes being compared to here the problem arises
 from the fact that rouses songs are essentially pop tunes and theyd be a lot
 more immediate if someone with a stronger voice were singing them his skillful
 lyrics are also frequently shrouded by his delivery which is a damn shame
 because i get the feeling that these little vignettes could be quite affecting if
 properly read
 
 still rouse manages at least a couple strong candidates for a single with opener
 nothing gives me pleasure and miracle after a brief orchestrated intro
 entitled twilight the drums kick in with a spirited rhythm and rouse enters
 with only a spare keyboard line for support the vocals arent great but the
 doubletracking on the chorus of and dont you know nothing gives me pleasure
 like you do nothing has the strength to pull me through helps considerably
 the song is aided by its little sonic nuances like the little looped guitar
 sounds in the background and the quietly placed keyboard chords that help contour
 the verses
 
 miracle follows with a breezy keyboard melody and a brisk beat that grabs the
 ear perhaps better than anything else on the album sadly rouses expertly
 penned vocal melody is actually upstaged by the keyboards which simply have a
 more commanding tone still its a fine song with a good sense of dynamics in
 the bridge and an ultimately memorable melody
 
 from there christmas with jesus enters with some horrid fuzz bass and a less
 than spectacular melody and it becomes clear what a mixed bag the rest of the
 album is going to be the title track sounds great with another good keyboard
 melody a vague 70s soul feel and some nice vibes work from the autumn defenses
 pat sansone but once again the vocal melody is compromised by a weak performance
 feeling no pain rises prosodically skyward for its chorus lately ive been
 feeling no pain my heart is wide open but everything falls into place the
 rest of the song works well enough but doesnt quite match up to the peak of the
 chorus
 
 ears to the ground redeems things to some extent flowing smoothly on a steady
 groove augmented by hand percussion the subtle string flourishes and guitar
 parts in the background are what really make the song though as rouses voice
 is merely serviceable in the understated verses summer kitchen ballad leaves
 him alone with an acoustic guitar and some very subtle strings which is inadvisable
 at best as it is the only reason a lot of this music works in the first place
 is that rouse offers a strong rhythmic backing for his songs and without it his
 vocal limitations are all the more painfully noticeable
 
 the whole night through is a pleasant closer rouse can actually handle the
 fine melody this time partly because he sings in a higher register than usual
 which sounds a lot more natural but its a pleasant cap to a pleasant album
 that never really rises much above pleasant the whole record sounds good and
 producer roger moutenot yo la tengo freedy johnston should get a certain amount
 of credit for creating a unified atmosphere for rouses songs to live in under
 cold blue stars ultimately ends up describing the sound of the album almost
 perfectly and theres something to be said for that
 
 but at the end of the day under cold blue stars has me feeling pretty
 indifferent the record companys claim that these songs are loosely based
 around the trials and tribulations of a smalltown southern couple in the
 1950s only holds up if youre really looking hard for it and even then it
 seems like a strange claim to make as the album stands up much better when
 viewed as a simple collection of ruminations on relationships this aside
 under cold blue stars stands pretty firmly in the middle of that road i
 was talking about before and its up to you to decide if you want to bothermusical collaborations are a risky business even if the artists involved are brilliant theres a tendency for them to sink to the lowest common denominator during the recording process resulting in albums that are either lifeless bores or cartoonish fiascoes just look at the mick jaggerdavid bowie abomination dancing in the streets if you need proof of the latter this of course is a worstcase scenario but it just goes to show that youve gotta be careful when looking to collaborative albums for your musical fix in the rare cases where they work they offer something distinct combining to create a special chemistry each extracts something from the other that otherwise affect the music for example say waylon and willie or uh john denver and the muppetsstateless is a threeway collaboration between the seattlechicagobased instrumental trio unwed sailor indianas mostly instrumental quartet early day miners and photographer chris bennett over the course of a weekend last spring the two bands got together and dreamt up this score to bennetts grainy and haunting super 8 footage which was filmed on various trips across the united states and europe the resulting music is something like mark hollis leading tristeza though it definitely leans more towards the muppet end of the above spectrumunwed sailor is still probably bestknown because pedro the lions david bazan once drummed for them and the driving force behind the band jonathan ford used to be a member of the storied band roadside monument likewise early day miners are still working at shedding the specter of the fabled band from which they sprang the recently reformed but longdefunct ativinstateless offers five songs clocking in at a very digestible 30 minutes a major concern when dealing with music that moves at such a glacierpace but like a glacier it can be incredibly powerful over time the songs seem to have been mapped out on the large scale allowing plenty of room for improvisation within the expanse there is however one actual song with vocals from edms dan burton thats perfectly placed dead center on the album creating a nice overall flow and bridging the longer ambient drones and mathy picking that bookend the albumbennetts film is also included with the disc as a quicktime file and i highly recommend watching it along with the music although this presents a problem for people like me with horrible computer speakers music this subtle loses a lot of its character when piped through tiny koss amplifiers of course you dont get the complete statement without the accompanying images and to be totally honest the music doesnt exactly provide a fully encompassing sonic experience on its own if youve got the proper equipment to witness the av assault stateless at least offers a fine alternative to the dreck being sent through the digital wires of expanded cable these days if not theres always denver henson lets face it meshuggah are the kings of scandinavian metal theyre better than
 at the gates theyre better than the haunted lord knows theyre better than
 children of bodom and you might not have the balls to say it but fuck it i do
 theyre better than entombed past and present how can i make such a bold
 statement easy one word originality meshuggah doesnt sound like anyone
 else sure there are influences but as robert urichs main man emeril would
 say they kick it up a notch
 
 now soilwork theyre no meshuggah but theyre close damn close in fact
 they even reinvent some of meshuggahs greatest attributes just to drive that
 point home sure the guitar solos echo fredrik thordendals and even bjorn
 strids vocals have taken on a jens kidmanlike affectation but with enough
 quick stops and starts to put you in a neckbrace and a sonic assault as raw as
 a head of lettuce natural born chaos stands as their tightest and most
 pummeling record yet the fact that it tops 2000s staggering the chainheart
 machine is only icing but victorious icing after last years spotty a
 predators portrait
 
 the one thing soilwork has working in their favor that meshuggah dont though
 is a goddamned sense of melody i know what youre thinking but yes theres
 plenty of room in metal for melody ask steve fucking harris if you dont believe
 me soilwork switches back and forth between completely brutal thrash metal to
 melodic power metal without so much as battering an eyelash all of the key
 elements to a good metal record are here its crunches and grinds with growling
 verses and anthemic choruses and of course there are those glorious fucking
 guttural demonic invocations that in some other genres are referred as vocals
 there are even keyboards for christs sake im talking good atmospheric shit
 too not that overbearing inyourface classical crap enchant forces on the
 dream theater pansies think separate ways not the final countdown
 
 in fact the only real drawback to the record as a whole is that some of its songs
 just sound like the old soilwork imagine if you were halfway through a listen to
 the flaming lips the soft bulletin and right in the middle they threw in
 some stuff from hit to death in the future head dont get me wrong
 hit to death is a damn good album but you know you dont get that kind
 of contrast on records we in the business would call classics
natural born chaos peaks with the backtoback shrapnelspitting of as we
 speak and the flameout both are incredibly dense and heavy and somehow also
 maniacally catchy a combination that has evaded most of the strongest swedish
 metal bands going also it should be noted that mindfields has one of the
 coolest pauses ive heard in a while who doesnt like a good pause the only
 two songs that most readily come to mind as being misses are the title track which
 could nearly make it onto mtv if it rode out its opening rhythm and the closer
 song of the damned which anticlimactically loses some of the steam the rest of
 the album had built up but i only name those two songs because i feel like i have
 to name something theyre not actually bad songs theyre just not quite
 as mindaltering as some of the others and song of the damned is a kinda dorky
 name whateverpitchfork is now officially at defcon 3 over the years our mailboxes have been
 perpetually packed with hundreds of virtually indistinguishable emo releases
 leaving our synonyms for the word whiny all but exhausted therein lies the
 greater problem the standard emo review has become just as formulaic and
 uninspired as the insipid genre which it criticizes one can only invoke the
 american music club so many times before carpal tunnels claims and recasts his
 cramped hands as veritable claws eternal tokens of his crusade against all that
 aches of unwieldy derivation luckily we found someone to stand in for brent but
 it goes without saying that our once proud emo reviews are quickly losing their
 potency in light of the cancerous popularity our sworn enemy is enjoying
 my first instinct upon hearing reubens accomplice was to a create a review
 comprised solely of cutandpasted excerpts from our archive as a sort of social
 commentary on unabashed genrebashing as critical synapse instead ive come
 to the admittedly selfserving conclusion that if reubens accomplice dont
 contribute anything discernibly different from their peers i shouldnt feel
 obligated to break from those traditions indigenous to my people
i blame the scenery at its best is an unpretentious exercise in puerility
 that yearns for the days of jilted playground love unfortunately whatever
 traumatic experiences culminated in the groups desire to make this kind of music
 seem to have stunted their musical and lyrical growth which are firmly mired in
 the politics of junior high opting to approximate the callow selfcenteredness
 of pubescence is not a crime in and of itself rather its the poor handling of
 the simple subject matter that damns reubens accomplice as just another m2 flavor
 of the week and makes i blame the scenery an often grating listen
 opening shows for the similarly marketed jimmy eat world might have influenced the
 songwriting throughout the course of the album the accomplice shed any
 distinguishing structural deviations and reveal themselves as exact carboncopies
 of their more commercially inclined emo counterparts but what jimmy eat world
 havent mastered is the art of cramming as many clichs as possible into the
 smallest given area something reubens accomplice accomplish with commanding
 authority on fireworks in short the songs a meditative midtempo nostalgic
 trip about a brownsweatered girl who singer jeff bufano saw smile under the
 fireworks one evening she is urged by bufano to come back and work it out
 theres a fine line between disarming simplicity and plain lack of talent though
 reubens accomplice sound like capable musicians i blame the scenery falls
 into far too many stylistic traps to achieve the emotional impact it intends
 maybe in the future bufano and company will overcome their drama and record
 something that doesnt send people through a painful series of winces and who
 knows if they wish upon a falling star all their dreams might just come
 true anything is possiblepost modernism is already a maligned enough generalization that critics hate
 using it as much as musicians hate being labeled as such over the past twenty
 years or so what was once a sly reference to integrating the mundane into real
 art has become a catchall for anything that quotes lines from coke ads or
 afterschool specials i dont believe it was ever supposed to be a joke though
 irony must have figured in somehow but now when i hear musicians strutting their
 pop culture stuff it provokes slight annoyance and suspicion more than any kind of
 serious attempt to find meaning in their secondhand statements
 
 of course there are exceptions to this becks often interesting and sometimes
 contrived am gold amalgams john zorns manic saturday morning freakouts and
 the downright odd cinematic society collages of david lynch some might argue
 that these artists are famous enough that their work has by definition surpassed
 the whole idea of post modernism and is merely modern others might claim
 that their fondness for iconic imagery and reference is actually a crutch to
 disguise their lack of originality and i have heard that criticism ridiculous
 as it is but really my only qualm with someone like john zorn is not that he
 depends too much on the mundane its that he doesnt spend enough its as if
 he has a disability to remain fixed on one aspect of his work long enough to
 maintain a clear relationship to anything and rather bounces like a mosquito from
 bright spot to bright spot it makes for very interesting music albeit often
 frustratingly flighty
 
 saxophonist ellery eskelin may yet be the supreme prophet of the postmodern in
 music this is a man who has seemingly taken it upon himself and conspirators
 jim black and andrea parkins to find the missing link between jazz rock
 electronic music pop and plain old everyday static where fellow new yorkers
 like zorn or tim berne might take the high road by writing unplayable tunes with
 insane levels of intensity eskelin organizes improvisational sessions for his band
 to summarize the chapters of their backgrounds all of which are considerably
 varied eskelin is also not afraid to play music that is superficially familiar
 ie many of his tunes sound like things you would hum on your own like melodies
 everyone knows without ever having been expressly taught
 
 the trio that made this album the seventh in a series part of a development
 program for the swiss hatology label has been together since 1994 eskelin had
 previously issued several solo albums in addition to gaining fairly widespread
 exposure with drummer joey barons barondown project percussionist jim black
 came to new york from seattle in the early 90s getting his biggest props with
 tim bernes bloodcount hes since become arguably the most indemand experimental
 percussionist in new york and keyboardistsampler player andrea parkins has made
 her name with eskelins group and for solo performances together they form one
 of the most interesting units in jazz and if there is any justice theyll find
 more funding to continue this series of recordings their grant only ran through
 2001
 
 similar to previous albums in the series 12 1 imaginary views calls on
 the collective experiences of the players to feed the music eskelins heavy jazz
 background he studied with dave liebman and george coleman among others and
 knack for penning subtly memorable melodies reminds me of similar strengths of
 another jazz populist thelonious monk like monk his music is often simple on
 the surface but repeated listens reveal a marvelously advanced efficiency in the
 arrangements as a bassless trio this is a plus and compositions fittingly
 this group plays the old masters oska t as a virtual encore at the end of the
 disc
 
 the anthemic opener describes its purpose as the first track and wastes no time
 in starting the show black is all over the kit and if you havent had the
 sincere pleasure of hearing him play by all means obtain this record the man is
 a genius and certainly deserves more space than can be allotted in this review to
 espouse on his imaginative virtuosic playing eskelins repetitive and forcibly
 catchy melody is supported by parkins accordion patch furthermore though i
 took this stuff without so much as a second thought i would be hardpressed to
 say what kind of music they were playing it wasnt really jazz wheres the
 swinging and solo section signpost certainly not rock even though black is
 terribly fond of dropping mad beats all over the place maybe a bit influenced
 by balkan rhythms and textures but not really best of all this lack of a label
 applies to every second of music on the album
 
 four chords features more hard beats by black and like the title says parkins
 giving you four chords on the piano there are a few dozen other things in there
 too such as what sounds like eskelin running his horn through a sewer pipe while
 playing flight of the bumblebee lowly is the first tune to really take
 advantage of the wide array of electronic effects at parkins disposal it begins
 with a spooky backdrop that sounds like a chorus of flies and leads to very
 aggressive pianoorgan improvisation soon eskelin enters over the bythen
 restrained organ playing relatively straightforward solo lines reminiscent of
 his old mentor liebman who was in turn following lateperiod coltrane what
 first seemed like an exercise in artistic electronic composition ends up an
 abstract funeral dirge
 
 elsewhere they kick out the jams plastiche makes life all the more worth
 living about three minutes in when it hits on the fucked up beats and super
 james bondstyle suspense melodies all praise be to black they pull a
 similar trick on grafik but wait until four minutes into a hefty improv
 session to hit you modular may be the best groove on the album though i
 can only describe the opening as kiss trying to play an ornette coleman
 tune they stretch out the middle with some rather hectic impressionism
 sounds like a hurricane to me and nail the tune to the wall at the end
 like bebop ruins
 
 i could go on about how the best stuff here was actually the softer yet more
 detailed electronic pieces like naked eye or gorgeous minimalism of combulatory
 but hopefully youll just go out and pick up the disc to hear for yourself
 eskelin doesnt quite get the headlines of some of his new york compatriots
 though it certainly isnt for lack of experience or creativity maybe the jazz
 instrumentation throws off all but the hardcore improvphiles or maybe people
 just dont have time for more than one or two downtown new york sax players
 whatever the case i can safely say that anyone missing eskelin and his band of
 real modernists is missing quite a lotamerica first caught a whiff of what richard james had to offer in early 1993
 when warp released the surfing on sine waves album under his polygon
 window alias though a few imports had already made a ripple stateside surfing
 on sine waves distributed by tvt marked the first time a james record could
 be found at domestic prices the album was originally one in a line of warps
 artificial intelligence releases a series that later birthed the muchmaligned
 genre designation intelligent dance music as part of the labels recent
 retooling of its catalog for a larger us audience surfing on sine waves
 has now been remastered and rereleased in the states with the addition of two
 unreleased tracks from the period
 in the wake of 2001s drukqs an album most aphex twin enthusiasts consider
 among the mans worst im still waiting for a used copy to show up its fun to
 get reacquainted with the old material if only to get an idea of what made james
 such an electronic music icon surfing on sine waves is rarely rated with
 the selected ambient works albums or the early singles collected on
 classics but its still a key record from the era that put james on the
 map and began the mythmaking that would mushroom to howard hughes proportions
 around the time of the windowlicker single
 listening to surfing on sine waves in the context of electronic music circa
 2002 i get an idea what it must have been like to listen to buddy holly in 1970
 naturally there are both positive and negative aspects to reexperiencing artifacts
 from an earlier time while this album is a crude template for what postrave
 electronic music would eventually become there is a charm in its technological
 navet and the records devotion to puritan virtues like chords and tunes is
 appealing in a postautechre world packed with overachieving signal processors
 catchy melodic and memorable tracks are what made the aphex twin so wonderful at
 his best surfing on sine waves has a handful of these albeit in rough
 embryonic form
 there are basically three kinds of tracks on this record the hard dancefloor bang
 the edgy midtempo bounce and the melodic ambient drift bangers like quoth and
 quixote are the weakest of the lot to my ears and they wind up being where the
 lack of technology is felt most though they surely sounded revolutionary on the
 93 dance floor the thin beats have since lost authority and lack the drum
 programming audacity that james would develop as the 90s wore on check
 isopropophlex and afx2 from the analog bubblebath ep and afx114 from
 caustic window compilation for far more commanding examples of this sound
 the propulsive midtempo numbers are what sound most interesting to me now the
 sour acid squelch of the roland tb303 is the lead instrument on both ut1dot
 and the untitled seventh track with the latter inflating the signature sound to
 almost comic proportions working against the harsh machinations of the 303 are
 soft layers of keyboards and tinny but gently insistent beats sometimes these
 three components seem to be navigating entirely different but complimentary paths
 giving the music an endless drifting quality turns toward the kind of melody
 that made james famous include the jittery pianodriven if it really is me
 which sounds like kraftwerk covering the theme from the young and the restless
 thats nadias theme for those of you without access to mary j blige liner
 notes
 the two unreleased tracks are solid and fit nicely with the original record
 portreath harbour is electro with a middle eastern tinge as robotic handclaps
 compete for space with a melody right out of lawrence of arabia redruth
 school is filled with repeating patterns of percussion with a fauxxylophone
 sequence providing counterpoint to the mournful synths wisely warp decided to
 keep the quiet and lovely quino phec as the album closer on this version of
 surfing on sine waves as it ranks with the best of aphexs ambient work
 in conjuring alien atmosphere though not quite an essential james release
 surfing on sine waves remains an excellent album from a fascinating and
 important period in electronic musicthe limitations of pop terminology being what they are my use of the word dreamy
 may be clouded with unfortunate associations and what a shame because if neil
 halsteads career from slowdive to mojave 3 were say the hint in a super
 password bonus round dreamy would be the 500 answer hiding behind that
 plastic blue slipcard burt convy confirmed this late last night when i ran
 into him at the supermarket then he gave me my change and sighed wistfully
 
 apparently not content with being the dominant creative force in mojave 3 halstead
 has now launched a solo career and his first strictlyneil outing sleeping
 on roads is perhaps unsurprisingly a pretty dreamy affair its the sort
 of disc youd want to have on hand for scenic twilight drives provided youre not
 the one driving what with its deft arrangements and mild vocals its an easy
 listen i took a long gratifying nap yesterday while this album played on repeat
 and if that makes you cringe youre probably better off spending your money on
 something a little more upbeat like ida
 
 to be fair see you on rooftops is by extremely liberal standards something of
 a rocker a muted southernfried electric guitar line seers over sudden bursts
 of junglelike breakbeats while warped keyboard tones echo boards of canadas
 signature style here halstead builds with the assistance of friends including
 fellow mojave 3slowdive bandmate ian mccutcheon an expansive sound heavy on
 ambient drones electronic strings and celestial sound effects
 
 but see you on rooftops and the records opener seasons are atypical on an
 album primarily comprised of the slow and sad think nick drake with a synth
 even if some of the more maudlin tracks do integrate offbeat instrumentation
 the title song features both banjo and dobro yet narrowly avoids sounding country
 theres also a halfcover of damien jurados ohio halstead acknowledges borrowing
 the melody though hes written a new set of lyrics for it and a considerable
 amount of material that sounds just a hell of a lot like belle and sebastian
 albeit without the lyrical smirk
sleeping on roads concludes with the spare acoustic high hopes one of
 its most affecting and depressing moments halstead does tack a happy ending
 of sorts onto the record though after several moments of silence the listener
 is treated to a quick taste of some of neils trademark dreampop as the album
 fades out the literal closing lullaby perfect for a short sleepy clever
 comment before moving onto greener pastures where sheep always jump placidly over
 flowered hedges
 
 but ill be direct here this is a far cry from neils artistic apex of course
 its comforting to realize he clearly isnt saving his best work for his solo
 records and thus holding out on mojave 3 which isnt to say sleeping on
 roads is without its charms but taking into account the sometimes spotty
 songwriting and its overtly dreamy similarities to mojave 3 like if theyd had a
 back massage and 1200mgs of valium there isnt much to save it from solo slump
 status i mean sure it sounds nice and all but the guy has records out there
 like souvlaki and ask me tomorrow trust me when i say youd rather
 be listening to those insteadso youve achieved success as an artist or musician well there are two paths
 you can take from here you can analyze that which made you successful break it
 down to its barest parts and see what makes it tick but be careful often all
 this overanalysis yields is the painful knowledge that what made your music work
 was the spontaneity and unbridled creativity that all your careful nitpicking and
 study would render obsolete your other option is the road with the rusty old
 sign plunked in the ground labeled hard work thats right just because youve
 made it doesnt mean you can take it easy if anything youll have to work even
 harder because everything youll do from this point on will be held up against
 that last amazing thing you did yup it turns out youre your own worst
 competition and worse yet working hard doesnt even guarantee continued triumph
 
 take rob mazurek and chad taylor for instance in the mid90s these two started
 a weekly improv gathering at chicagos infamous green mill jazz club which led to
 various recorded incarnations as the chicago underground duo trio quartet and
 orchestra its hard to pin down the moment when the chicago underground first
 achieved success all of its members are all consummate performers liable to
 amaze audiences whether theyre playing in a holeinthewall jazz venue a college
 auditorium or an oversized rock club every album released under the chicago
 underground banner has been undeniably solid as well so in a sense theyve been
 successful all along but in my mind the turning point came with 1999s
 synesthesia at times free jazz and at others as carefully structured as
 a good book synesthesia was a revelation on first listen and it remains
 absolutely stunning to this day
 
 last years chicago underground quartet album saw mazurek and taylor
 supplementing their usual fervent freejazz explorations with the dignified calm
 of 1950s bebopstyle jazz now the continually evolving duo heads for untraveled
 territory once more mazurek still plays cornet on axis and alignment and
 taylor still plays drums and vibraphones but here they take new chances with
 different instruments and sounds with mixed results
 
 average assumptions and misunderstandings finds cornetist mazurek plunking away
 at a piano first he interjects quick and staccato stabbing at the peaceful
 backdrop created by taylors vibraphones but as he picks deeper notes and the
 piano begins to resonate taylor switches places with him striking faster and
 faster at the pianos allencompassing rumble memoirs of a space traveler
 opens by following the nowfamiliar chicago underground formula for free
 improvisation driving cornet skronks rapidfire drums and a static electronic
 drones all fight for attention only everything collapses halfway through
 mazurek lingers on a note taylor strums an acoustic guitar and a laptop fixates
 on the synthesized sound of glass breaking predictably neither musician is
 anywhere near as talented with these new toys as they are with their usual
 instruments but the new sounds are a refreshing change of pace after three
 albums of little more than cornet vibes and drums
 
 most notable on axis and alignment are the electronics while the duos
 previous two albums made use of foundmanipulated sound and occasional powerbook
 flourishes this release sees them stepping into the forefront their role is
 still mostly minimal but one can sense a certain confidence no doubt mazureks
 work on orton socket his superb solo laptop project released last year on jim
 orourkes moikai label has made him more comfortable in front of a monitor
 
 in many cases like the short introspective number lem the electronic elements
 are so minimal and atmospheric that they may easily go unnoticed but later on
 noon mazurek plays with this subtlety allowing the minimal rumbling in the
 background to all but conquer the other elements of the song by the time the song
 ends the electronics take on a much more structured form on exponent red and
 two concepts for the storage of light both built around synthesized basslines
 that seem lifted directly off isotope 217s who stole the iwalkman
 
 exponent serves as a necessary reprieve from some of the less structured numbers
 two concepts however is a long track that starts off structured gets crazy
 then calms again over the course of eight or nine minutes though a fine piece
 of music on its own it seems little more than a failed attempt to replicate the
 greatness of blue sparks form her and the scent of lightning the stunning
 opening track from synesthesia where that song took listeners on a
 literarystyle journey complete with foreshadowing and false climaxes two
 concepts seems a bit more content just to stay in one place
 
 for all its great moments extra flourishes and new explorations axis and
 alignment never quite matches the gripping nature or the emotional resonance
 of its predecessor but mazurek and taylor should be commended for branching out
 for insisting on trying something new when churning out a replica of past successes
 might well have seemed easier its a tough decision for any artist to make but
 then no one ever said success would be easyrock critic standby statement 842 were now living in the age of the producer
 its true a close look at the pop charts from the last couple of years reveals
 that todays biggest hitmakers arent britney or jlo or madonna but eq wizards

 the men behind the board carried such bankability in the industry now more and
 more were seeing these berproducers cutting out the middlemen releasing albums

 rapinclined pronounced white crowd whose rap collection doesnt run beyond
 ill communication
 i dont hold myself above the latter group the deltron 3030 project was one of
 the few hiphop albums to penetrate my guitarloyal musical sensibilities though
 that was at least half because im a scifi geek who enjoys hearing neuromancer
 and gamera namedropped ill even admit to enjoying the gorillaz album the
 singles from which have provided the first digestible mtv fare in years and
 frankly anyone who collaborates with mike patton earns a spot on my good list
 no matter what the project the automator consistently has brought a sound just
 organic enough just diversely influenced enough just safe enough to catch my
 ear
 so the idea of an automatorchosen mixtape session billed as a look into my
 head by the man himself appealed to me featuring the likes of tortoise and
 air rubbing up against brand nubian and dilated peoples i expected a gonzo
 display of effortless genrehopping and styleblending despite nakamura not
 being wellknown for his dj scratching skills
 all right yeah you know from the rating where this is heading wanna buy a
 monkey didnt live up containing a number of selections from the automators
 own projects alongside some of his handpicked favorites from other artists
 monkey comes off resembling either a padded greatesthits comp or an
 inspired by soundtrack for a nonexistent movie what it certainly isnt is
 a dj mix where previously hidden links between seemingly unrelated songs are
 unearthed through the ancient art of juxtaposition
 part of the problem lies in the musically segregated organization of the album
 as the automators hiphop selections are clumped into the front and back while
 the indiefriendly picks comprise the creamy center this allows nakamura to
 splice tracks together with minimal segue ingenuity mostly using the radio 101
 technique of slowly fading in the beat from the ondeck song meanwhile the one
 opportunity to flaunt highflying mixing ability deltron 3030s positive contact
 into airs le soleil est pres de moi is handled with all the dexterity of a
 onearmed drummer rick allen notwithstanding
 sadly these short betweensong mixtures as inventive as they aint are the most
 compelling manipulations of the album the automators additions to the members
 of his allstar team fall under the categories of nearinvisible the vocal sample
 added to a portion of tortoises seneca or distracting the generic beat and
 one two vocals clumsily added to airs ethereal le soleil even nakamuras
 own productions lovage xecutioners an early black rob track are left alone
 with only the original version of gorillaz latin simone deviating significantly
 from the album version
 to dans credit wanna buy a monkey confirms what was already apparent
 from his own work namely that he has classy and diverse musical taste theres
 hardly a disagreeable pick among the sixteen present and most reflect the same
 sensibilities nakamura adds to his own music live instruments latin flavoring
 positive lyrical messages but something tells me i would be more sold on the
 liner notes claim that he has something very personal to say on this record if
 the artists presented were early influences rather than contemporaries
 its hard to imagine who would want to pick up this disc as most automator fans
 would likely own a majority of the cuts appearing with minuscule changes here
 perhaps wanna buy a monkey could be justified as a listening guide to
 point fans towards artists with the automator stamp of approval but this goal
 could have been just as easily accomplished by reading an online interview and
 booting up your audiogalaxy satellite and with almost nothing in the way of
 imaginative mixing never mind a 1699 price tag wanna buy a monkey
 seems nothing more than an early contender for the onions least essential

 tell us about yourself what are you like what are some of your interests
 

 i feel so weird doing this i usually have no problems meeting people in bars but
 my friend dared me to try pitchfork personals so here i am but please ladies
 if you dont have a picture dont bother replying

 beats are the number one priority in my life if you like creative beats youll
 like me besides for beats i also like red lobster lucy liu and unprotected sex
 rhymes and lyrics are important but i dont mind sharing i do it all the time
 with my friends huggy and alshid but regardless of whos on the mic the rhymes
 are raw sex underage sex unprotected sex and other variations on the theme
 tight as shit and damn funny you make as much noise as en vogue without dawn
 i dont care about being a hiphop purist i dont care what hiphop is all
 about i am about starting a fucking party maybe even a fucking party if
 you give up some of that ass


 tell us about your sound
 

 like i was saying before beats mean so much to me i need someone who can handle
 beats being number one in my life they truly are my passion the ladies tell me
 i have kind of an automator thing going fuck that i dont do that grandiosity
 and sophistication bullshit im about the ghetto and if youre nice i can be
 real playful see namedropping dont cut it with me im unique check the
 blundering samples on qa and live from pimp palace east the carnival
 quality of something lifted from an episode of the three stooges or keystone
 cops girl who does this all im saying the shit is dope

 and i got more where that came from check the bum bitch ballad im all
 sampling strings and accordions almost to where it brings up visions of a
 pastoral french landscape but i dont wanna get too romantic about it so i
 play it cool we wanna have ourselves a good time not a picnic lunch so
 instead of a blanket and an amour i litter the landscape with the world record
 for consecutive spokenword bitch samples take that france even if the
 beat wasnt so good the humor of the irony itself is a thing to behold later on
 the album i get back to strings but with a spin this time fuckin up the
 money featuring huggy combines strings with a howling vocal background
 sounds stark right but primed for the dancefloor enjoy


 how would your best friends describe you
 

 well maybe ive gained a reputation but its not as bad as it sounds i went
 out on a date with that asshole jzone once he took me to red lobster and
 when the waiter came he stuck me with the fucking check hes just mad cuz i
 never gave him any play then he tried to talk to my sister a week later yeah
 fuck jzone from jzone fan club


 do you have any special talents
 

 i battle my talking dick aka thug penis played by huggy on the ingenious the
 trojan war last weekend he got a little pissed that i insisted on unprotected
 sex you better put a hat on my head before i play dead like i did the last
 time to get us both thrown out of bed the prick went so far as to threaten me
 and my nuts with nonperformance even though were the same age ill cum
 premature and blame it on the balls


 why you should get to know me
 

 yall are looking for someone with an underground sound and serious street
 credibility ie if they ever heard me i would appeal to all motherfuckers
 youre sick of mcs pontificating you know that not every brother has a
 projectsized political chip on his shoulder and not every one who doesnt is
 named will smith so if you fine baby and you want a master player write me
 back for real ima get up in that
the screaming face on the cover suggests that this will be some kind of crazy
 music cranked up with anger against the man eugene mcdaniels the left rev
 mc d has religion in his soul and you know how wild those guys get just dig
 the book of revelations references in the lord is back the lord is mad his
 dispositions mean hes travelin the road of mass destruction and this is
 from 1971 so you can bet that racists hawks and richard nixon are at the top of
 his shit list
 
 any thought that this album is a novelty relic wears off though when you realize
 how sincere and frequently great it is headless heroes of the apocalypse
 has been a lost vinyl classic since it came out thirty years ago and this reissue
 has been trickling into record stores since sometime last year the record is an
 eclectic mix of soul funk and even folk with a crack jazz band backing mcdaniels
 a jazz singer himself in the 60s and a hit songwriter and producer in the 70s
 its attracted less attention and support than the reissue of shuggie otis
 inspiration information but it has its own legend allegedly it went out
 of print because spiro agnew himself called atlantic records to complain about the
 content and atlantic stopped promoting the album
 
 this is hard to believe agnew should have had bigger problems than bullying
 artists but more importantly mcdaniels lyrics actually sound more concerned
 than angry he rages against injustice but hes more interested in hope even
 as god prepares for judgment day mcdaniels reminds us his smile is warm and
 soothing as the morning light rather than targeting anyone to hate mcdaniels
 tries to protect us and warn us as on the title track he pleads with warring
 sides jews and the arabs left wing and right wing niggahs and crackers
 to get them to see that theyre pawns we are the cannon fodder the earnest
 cry of the chorus better get it together and see whats happening emerges from
 a real love on the gorgeous ballad freedom death dance he chides us for looking
 away everyone wants piece of mind everybody says we should ignore the graves
 we dance upon mcdaniels smooth tenor while technically not one of the best
 is direct and empathetic hes a preacher a favorite uncle and the offthewall
 guy sitting next to you at the bar
 
 which is why mcdaniels comes across not as an extremist or as some kind of
 character but as a pretty reasonable guy he sings about war but he also sings
 an acoustic folk song susan jane about getting it on with a rich crazy hippie
 girl and theres supermarket blues which recounts how he got in a racially
 motivated fight over a can of peas the late60searly70s era also informs
 lovin man a song about an extremely mortal jesus a sensuality seeker whose
 message of spiritual and physical love could get him in trouble with the pigs
 yet the album doesnt really sound dated until the last track the parasite for
 buffy saintemarie a tenminute tribute to the native americans that ends
 abruptly in a freakout mcdaniels starts to scream with horror at their plight
 and the band jumps to frantic noise the clamor may be abrupt to modern ears
 but as always his heart is in it
 
 as great as the lyrics are headless heroes of the apocalypses resurgence
 can be credited to the terrific music the album has been prized and sampled by
 the hiphop community for years that get it together line should be familiar to
 most of you from the beastie boys ill communication if nothing else and
 freedom death dance shows up on the first a tribe called quest album mcdaniels
 taps some great musicians the rhythm section includes gary king idris muhammad
 george benson on electric bass plus weather report members miroslav vitous on
 upright and alphonse mouzon on drums mouzon particularly stands out with crisp
 drumwork thats seamlessly integrated but breaks out all over the place the band
 can play it smooth on the slower jagger the dagger or freedom death dance or
 lift headless heroes on richie resnikoffs guitar and harry dhitakers electric
 piano
 
 the album sounds so ebullient you almost forget that mcdaniels message of love
 comes wrapped around the evils of racism ethnic conflict and the bomb and its
 that shout at the end of the parasite that knocks you awake again and summons
 up that wrath he was warning about earlier all the problems mcdaniels sings
 about are still going on and what was that about judgment day coming soon
 is spiro agnew dead yet maybe its not too late to save himit seems like joe pernice has been around forever fact is though pernice first
 moseyed onto the scene in 1995 as a member of the scud mountain boys a moderately
 acclaimed altcountry troupe on sub pop famous for their breakupsex anthem
 grudgefuck after three lps with the boys joe took an artistic sidestep into
 the world of classic pop think the beach boys and the byrds meet elvis costello
 founding the pernice brothers their first lp overcome by happiness was
 met by mixed reviews most somewhat critical of the albums inconsistency last
 years superb the world wont end silenced the earlier criticism cutting
 out most of the flat spots from the debut while retaining and multiplying its
 highs
 between the two pernice brothers releases however joe recorded a couple of
 side projects chappaquiddick skyline and big tobacco big tobacco reissued by
 his ashmont label in 2001 stands apart from the majority of side projects mostly
 because it sounds nothing like one the tunes although originally slated to
 comprise the fourth scud mountain boys lp are all instantly reminiscent of the
 pernice brothers except with a little less grandeur ie no string arrangements
 and an even more apparent moodiness
 one of the most welcome similarities is the production quality pernices bandmate
 thom monahan produced big tobacco with joes assistance and shows a keen ear
 for classic pop directing firm clear rhythm lines and complementary guitar
 accompaniment the simplicity in the background places all of the focus on joes
 voice a great one melodies and lyrics this is also where the album either
 rises or falls
 the opener prince valium is one of the stronger tracks on the disc employing
 a very familiar fourchord progression and a songstructure a bit more dynamic
 than most on the album like the tasteful bridge where the band cuts out leaving
 only drums and sixstring acoustic the chorus is also a winner both the peppy
 melody and pernices typically somber lyrics because the cure is long in coming
 and it never lasts so long guess a little was just a little too much to ask you
 for always knew youd be going but i did not know just when so help me lord
 get me stoned again
 bum leg is another good one spinning a convincing story of violence and despair
 got a rattle in my chest the way it sounds like a barrel full of broken bottles
 rolling the through the night hitting every fucking pothole in this town over
 westernflavored orchestration that somehow avoids sounding clichd the opening
 to undertow replaces the kit with kettle drums which with a beatlesesque
 guitar progression forms an odd but successful rhythm track the strength of the
 song as usual comes with the lyrics stuck in the undertow stuck in a rut you
 dug all your own too high to make it home and you fall anywhere youre standing
 its never going to be that easy again from now they always go down screaming
 once you could hide it well now it shows everybody knows the bloom is off the
 rose even when nothing else goes right pernices lyrics almost bail him out
 on their own the man has a way with words
 if youve heard joe pernice you know what youre getting with big tobacco
 lyricsfocused classic pop delivered by a talented songwriter and wordsmith the
 collection of tunes here may not be quite as punchy or seamless as those on the
 world wont end but theyre still a solid palatable bunchhowe gelb wants you to know that hes too fucking cool as he starts to sing
 marty robbins el paso his voice barely lifts above a whisper the acoustic
 guitar strums lightly poignantly behind him you sense that drummer joe
 convertino is wearing a suit and that it looks really sharp the melodrama of
 this gunfighter ballad comes through but suavely and even when gelb stops in
 the middle to shred through neil youngs out on the weekend it still sounds
 badass
 
 giant sand is howe gelbs onemanband plus guests operating out of tucson
 arizona giant sand has been performing original material since the mid80s that
 loosely sits in the camps of rock and altcountry their latest album cover
 magazine is a cover album of classic and kitschy country and rock songs
 this kind of record is usually dismissed as a secondtier project just like
 live albums and for basically the same reason going in youre not expecting a
 major original statement its true that gelb never sounds like hes breaking a
 sweat here but theres invention and heart in these tunes and the range is
 impressive stretching from marty robbins and johnny cash to pj harvey and
 goldfrapp
 
 the biggest selling point here is the cover of black sabbaths iron man which
 gelb reworks into a congapadded lounge number his understated and dead serious
 vocals make the lyrics sound extra bizarre heavy boots of lead fill his victims
 full of dread and the hook is catchy on piano the second most entertaining
 cover is sonny and chers the beat goes on his take on which seems particularly
 knowing this version is slicker and has a better rhythm than the original
 thanks largely to joe burns bass gelbs wife sofia dig the parallel adds
 wry backup vocals
 
 gelb tackles most of the instruments himself but hes joined by some impressive
 guests on xs johnny hit and run pauline his guitar goes from a tense quiet
 to a blaring fury and pj harvey sings on the chorus her wail dripping with
 blood gelb also covers one of harveys songs a bluesy performance of plants
 and rags the untreated electric guitar sounds like it was recorded out in the
 garage most of the songs use the rhythm section of burns on upright bass and
 convertino on drums and theyre terrific burns bassline on king of the road
 is big and easygoing on this only mildly downandout version of the classic
 
 although the performance of johnny cashs im leaving now adios is too casual
 this is the only song where the vocals drop from impromptu to halfassed burns
 and convertino still sound like they rolled right out of sun studio the last
 two numbers not counting a silly reprise of the beat goes on are live recordings
 with members of grandaddy these tunes cover more familiar territory for gelb
 former giant sand member rainer ptaceks the inner flame and an expanded
 version of gelbs blue marble girl thats sprawling and gorgeous riding on
 his keyboards and jim fairchilds massive guitar
cover magazine is a diverse album that holds together well the sound
 quality is solid and some of the recordings have a vast atmosphere particularly
 that deadofnight desert setting for el paso the record never escapes being
 a cover album mainly because gelb takes most of the songs so easily but the
 point of the album seems to be to let him play entertainer from the raw but
 theatrical johnny hit and run pauline to that piano line on iron man thatll
 be stuck in your head for days not bad for what could as easily have been just
 another throwaway vanity releaseman do i hate sammy sosa i hate his damn fool tenminute long posthome run
 interpretive dance i hate his damn fool tv commercials for his damn fool video
 game its soo reeeeeal i hate his damn fool i love baseball im
 friends with everybody locker room interviews and i still hate sammy
 sosa even now that hes surprisingly begun making strange slowcore records on
 his home computer with all his millions of dollars you would think he could
 afford some better squinting hey wait a second this says saso not sosa
 damn this dyslexia
 
 well i dont know nothing about this saso but the name conjures images of a
 chris kattanlike male stripper if you say it with enough flash the liner
 notes dont help any as its unclear whether the saso entity is a group
 instrumentation and arrangements by saso or the solitary project of one
 man musicnoises and words by jim lawler and his budgetclass recording
 equipment the saso website is no help either consisting mainly of
 notveryoriginal modemcrashing shockwave design even a google search failed
 me providing only the name of saso janfuski a chorus performer on some pink
 floyd tribute album from 2000
 
 the music on big group hug is just as mystifying since saso himselfitself
 doesnt appear to know what the hell heit is the opening title track is a
 washedout canvas of melancholy pop with yorkeishly high vocals floating over a
 soft bed of simple acoustic guitar keyboards and lightly tapped drums but the
 second track bird brain is a lengthy and stagnant instrumental that at one
 point headscratchingly throws in a seinfeld sample and blood bath switches
 gears again with diet neu what gives
 
 one clue to sasos identity may lie in the sonic continuity between the albums
 ten songs namely the midfi bedroomrecluse feel most instruments are
 recorded as if from under a pillow with the tone uniformly fuzzy and warm like a
 rhodes electric piano songs are usually left sparse dimwit and all my life
 appear drumless while dripfeed contains little more than piano and voice
 
 but one could argue that things are left overly scanty as the majority of the
 album breezes by without leaving any debris lodged in my memory the instrumental
 tracks generally dont do enough to justify their existence and the melodramatic
 vocals on somebody arent much of an improvement occasionally however this
 saso produces some earcatching sounds like the vespertine music box
 opening of my brain hurts and the unexpected stomp in the middle of lazy bones
 
 too bad these elements arent packaged into actual songs instead of coming across
 as a series of portfolio pieces for somebodys potential producersbandmates
 looking for that woody organic intimate microphones sound but cant afford phil
 elvrum call saso he or they is cheap unless of course saso really is sosa
 i wouldnt put it past the bastardenglands matthew herbert is known more for his musical process than his actual
 output his work is guided by his contract for the composition of music
 manifesto a kind of dogma 95style treatise on musicmaking in the information
 age herbert frowns on sampling other music synthesizer presets and drum
 machines and gives the thumbsup to human error his 2000 mix cd is titled
 lets all make mistakes his selfimposed limitations have driven him to
 include a certain amount of acoustic instrumentation including his own
 accomplished piano work while pointing him toward unusual sound sources for his
 rhythmic sequencing
 
 on 2001s overlooked gem bodily functions he borrowed some of the sound
 sources matmos used on a chance to cut is a chance to cure made his own
 recordings of organic phenomena and incorporated the lot into subtle elegant
 pop music that alternated between effortless house tracks and vaguely loungy
 acoustic jazz when i first heard bodily functions i almost couldnt
 believe how good it was but when i looked to others to share my enthusiasm
 the responses were decidedly mixed some heard genius in the album others failed
 to connect with herbert at all while still others praised his earlier around
 the house album as vastly superior as fate would have it around the
 house originally released in 1998 has now been reissued
 
 if bodily functions had some stylistic parallels with matmos a chance
 to cut around the house is more closely aligned with the san francisco
 duos quasi objects as on that early matmos effort herbert integrated the
 sounds of objects in and around his home into his songs the comparisons should
 really stop there though because herberts musical goals are completely different
 herbert is a song man bent on crafting relaxed tasteful and ultimately very
 danceable tunes and his use of the field recordings differs sharply unlike
 matmos herbert has no respect for the integrity of the sources and shows little
 interest in using the original context as a reference point the effect of whatever
 esoteric sampling methods are used are essentially inaudible on around the
 house but what emerges loud and clear is another exceptional and creative
 album
 
 as on the later bodily functions the songs on around the house are
 voiced by the sultry dani siciliano she sings on just under half the tracks and
 the rest consist of either instrumental house numbers still rife with vocal
 samples or moodier more experimental pieces the albums highlight comes early
 in the form of so now its first real track after a short bit of ambient
 foolery even after hearing it 30 times or more in the last week this song has
 me hitting the back button like a skinnerian pigeon aching for a food pellet
 it has a lush and spacious rhythmic backdrop comprised of little more than a
 clicking pseudosnare a house thump and a simple round bassline but the vocals
 are what make it special the callandresponse interplay between sicilianos
 lead and the breathy backup singers is gorgeous the kind of music i imagine
 prince composing after god finally calls the purple one 2 heaven
 
 almost as accomplished is the sunny uptempo going round which alludes just
 slightly to the jazz fixation that would flower on bodily functions even
 more instructive for these comparisons is the last beat which appears in
 different forms on both albums as is typical of the differences between the two
 records the version here is a bit more electronic and focused on ambience the
 fullon torch song approach that marks the most recent record was more of a flicker
 at this stage in lieu of gently brushed cymbals the song gives a percussive
 shape to a tangle of static
 
 a handful of brilliant tracks stand out on the remainder of the album from
 light warm and justplainbeautiful instrumental house close to me we
 still have the music to gurgling ambient tracks thick with nuanced sound
 design and brilliant arrangements we go wrong to tracks that morph from one
 mode into the next this time i would not personally rate around the house
 quite as high as bodily functions but this could well be a matter of which
 record i heard first herbert was a bit more focused on sound than song on this
 record but the overall approach is not markedly different both albums are loaded
 with music of exceptionally high qualityin the earlytomid 1980s mattel released a series of barbie dolls dressed up in
 madonnaesque accessories to capture the imaginations of the mtv generation the
 rockers were an allfemale proposition though if memory serves rocker ken had
 some vague role drummer perhaps and each doll came with a plastic instrument
 and an eplength cassette tape featuring massproduced seminew wave songs about
 loving to rock the fortunate girl could get the entire setup all the band
 members the stage the backdrop etc play the tape and live out rock and
 roll fantasies me i only had two rockers barbie and the brunette bassist
 whatever her name was my best friend and i would gather all our rocker paraphernalia
 and stage elaborate concerts for her brothers action figures in retrospect these
 events had a decidedly woodstock flair as heman gi joe boba fett and the
 stray transformer put aside their differences and came together to enjoy barbies
 greatest hits
 i dont know if the all girl summer fun band has quite the same unifying effect
 though one might imagine their shows as places where exriot grrls giggly
 teenage hipsters closet pedophiles sensitive indie rock boys and misogynists
 inclined toward muttering i told you so and it wouldnt be much of a stretch
 to suggest that these portland girls resemble a lofi barbie and the rockers
 four girls of slightly differing appearances playing cute grated songs about
 cute boys in cute little girl voices and its all informed by 60s brill building
 girlgroup pop replete with nods to brian wilson their music pushes the outside
 parameters of twee and ushers the listener into a fantastic world where all the
 girls giggle and blush at attention wear polkadot bikinis and sparkly barrettes
 and never kiss and tell
 im 99 sure the members of the summer fun band are cognizant of the image theyre
 sending out and im positive they expect the listener to enjoy the implicit ironies
 and delight in the retropop sensibilities while imagining the simpler preriot
 grrl days its not exactly campy that would entail maintenance of the beehive
 hairdos suggested by the salon hairdryer cover art nor particularly original
 fans of barebones pop music might love this its innocuous enough and as the
 name suggests summery and fun
all girl summer fun band offers thirteen short songs reminiscent of cub
 without the crunch featuring a minimal threechord midtempo song structure
 that varies only on the albums two slow numbers somehow angels and girl 3
 beyond that theres not much to say theme song admittedly features one of
 the best unanticipated screams ive heard following a bubblegum chorus of were
 the all girl summer fun band la la la la la la and its there provides a
 slight variation on the albums continually recycled song structure by tossing in
 a nice jazzy chorus over which the girls intone shoobydoo ive got a crush on
 you no point in getting into the lyrics beyond that though you get the point
 for the record i dont have a problem with this kind of bersimplistic music
 in fact im a long time defender of rock and pop music in its purest threechord
 forms but the girls overt reliance on selfconscious cuteness really rubs me
 wrong the fauxprepubescent vocals and the coy deliberately offkey harmonies
 grate like the swiss cheese sentiments inherent in the banal lyrics and maybe my
 problem is a bit political too women in rock and particularly women within
 the maledominated indie rock sect are already faced with enough patronizing
 bullshit and the all girl summer fun band not only feeds this mentality but
 knowingly plays up to it
 of course it could be im just too old for the kind of allgirl summer fun this
 band claims to deliver but the truth is if i want to listen to shameless pop
 with an estrogen twist im much more inclined to reach for destinys child
 their music may be equally insipid but at least you can dance to itrephlex have never got beyond being recognized as the label
 that aphex helped to build though hes not released anything
 significant on the label the aphex ghost wanders nightly
 through its halls sometimes that spectral presence is so
 strong that people are ready to mistake artists entirely
 unrelated to aphex as being him by another name johnny hawk
 who records under the wahoo global goon alias is a victim of
 mistaken identity hawks debut album 1996s goon was
 widely credited to aphex guess it didnt bug him
 
 but just a cursory listen to goon would have let the
 secret out that global goon and aphex were not born from the
 same pod hawk doesnt share aphexs appreciation for modern
 composition and freakout that album while absurd owes
 more to the slomo wing of braindance than to the splattercore
 cadre its opening track st michael is the idm cousin of
 the falls birmingham school of business school both share
 a straightfaced dadaists reading of university course
 catalogs synchropeet is a ploddingly accompanied vocal raga
 for the mogadondependent
 
 hawks followup to goon cradle of history
 collected twenty casio melodies and confirmed his position
 within the lightly comic section of the braindance organization
 now with his third album vatican nitez hawk deftly
 combines these two threads together to produce an amalgam of
 absurdly fauxnaif tuneful idm
vatican nitez doesnt waste time with an intro hooray
 its straight into business man and into forty minutes of
 smileinducing nuttiness one of the first noticeable differences
 between this and earlier works is that it sounds as though hawks
 got access to much better equipment these days the album
 doesnt sound cheap a gimmick that long ago lost its currency
 because hes no longer obscured by hiss i can fully appreciate
 the goons concealed artistry jerky dharma turns a dalliance
 with vaguely asian tonalities into something much less
 patronizing during im on the 73 hawk attempts to conceal
 his invention by sending every musical element through an
 immense echo chamber despite his most ardent efforts you can
 easily discern his idiosyncratic skill kreem ballet sums up
 in five minutes all seven studio volumes of pete namlooks
 dark side of the moog series and further slaps down
 namlook with a firstrate no pussyfooting impression
 
 the midtempo mystery named stans slaves possesses such a
 powerful undertow that id love to hear what hawk could do in
 collaboration with goldfrapp carries on the exploration
 of tidal currents adding whistling and woodblock percussion
 but by the time the album gets to scott cronce is the ceo
 hawk has lost steam the swathes of ambience and the ropethick
 tubeway army tune totally crush the generic hiphop beats
 underneath hawk heaps some analog squiggles on top in a vain
 effort to distinguish the track globy dubes champeen of all
 americky nearly suffers from the same malady but hawk ends
 up correcting previous error by shooting nervy breakneck
 sequencer lines through the plodding hiphop and the squiggles
 
 though hawks latest suggests that spending some chillout
 time with john paul ii isnt as awkward as id have suspected
 vatican nitez is far from revolutionary unlike former
 labelmate leila hawk isnt trying to redefine a sound if
 youre satisfied with that vatican nitez is a
 satisfying enough means of cerebral exertionheres a fun piece of pitchfork trivia though theyve released more than 100
 albums since the late 80s theres not a single muslimgauze review in the
 pitchfork archive its a matter of timing really bryn jones died before our
 site started covering electronic music in a serious way and the labels he
 recorded for extreme staalplaat and many others never happened to appear
 on the promo radar so until a massive reissue project gets underway the
 official artist website remains the definitive source for information about
 the mysterious muslimgauze
 i bring up the late great muslimgauze not because of all the interesting things
 happening in the arab world is anyone else almost glad that bryn jones didnt
 live to see the postseptember 11th political landscape but because i hear
 something familiar in this excellent new album by british hiphop aficionado
 req its not the tone but the method that strikes a chord muslimgauze was so
 prolific in part because his pieces tended to be simple in construction they
 were often built on the foundation of a single perfectly crafted loop over which
 jones would splatter bits of noise and various dubderived mixing effects
 req also gets serious mileage out of a lone repeating loop and he shows a similar
 affinity for a rough and ragged analog sound laced with simple melodic motifs
 theres a spirited rawness to

 thats both disarming and
 immediately engaging though elements feel familiar the tone here is striking
 and unconventional hiphop is an obvious touchstone but even the most minimal
 hiphop production feels thick and cluttered next to reqs naked approach though

 hell surely feel much more at home at the more
 experimental warp

 a handful of interesting aphexian ambient interludes pop up on this record but
 the rhythm tracks are its heart and soul some of these pieces consist of nothing
 but a tomtom a bass drum a hihat and the faintest hint of a chord dolby c
 could almost come from a break record such is its relentlessly strippeddown
 approach to rhythm its uncanny how a track so not there can remain so
 inyourface and hypnotic just as good is upstairs with its rusty brian
 decklike junkyard beats and a strange vibraphone melody repeating periodically
 the percussion on these tracks is bonedry and bass heavy with a thud that hits
 like a fist to the solar plexus

 when req decided to add more elements to this sound his inspiration can come
 from anywhere which keeps the record exciting not tied to any theme or style
 the pieces are free to veer off into uncharted textural territory sketchies
 death track adds a shaker a chinese gong and a thumb piano to a loose tribal
 beat and i seek is fatbottomed hiphop with an ominous threenote piano riff
 that would do the rza proud something is nothing more than a closely miked
 drum kit some kind of melodic percussion bit and a sample of a vocal drone
 somewhere deep in the background while ampeg 18 khz is a seriously compressed
 funk beat with hand percussion and some odd accordion stabs the development
 throughout each track is slight but effective always keeping you tuned in to
 hear what happens next

 ive no doubt

 of slight variations on wellestablished themes and its difficult to find an
 album that sounds truly new
 
 sketchbook
 
 is such a record
the leels have no edge even their name has no hard consonant
 sounds their music a mushy combination of folksy rock and
 avantpop squishes between your fingers as you dig for a
 clear hook or a percussive sound the members of the band
 have obvious talent and a lot of ideas but everything sinks
 into a pleasing ambience it splats against your ears like
 the spineless sea creatures that crawl across its back cover
 
 the members of the leels floridians trey connor of meringue
 and home alumni chris sturgeon and eric morrison split the
 singing songwriting and instrumental work each of the
 fourteen songs has its own creative sound the guitar and
 vocal effects on the lilting lush melody of
 arbor day or sandra shockleyladens gossamer flute backdrop
 on throttle floridian towel with its strong chorus and
 guest drew blomquists crisp drumwork sounds like it could
 fit on the first sea and cake album though the leels dont
 reach that bands stealthy efficiency
 
 even though the ideas are impressive it takes several listens
 to appreciate them the album has an appealing sound slightly
 wistful slightly ironic but its not striking and the
 instruments sound like theyre wrapped in gauze throttle
 goes down so easily that you can overlook its best qualities
 the production may appeal to people who like the carefully
 produced haze of say the flaming lips but the lips have
 more electricity maybe its too easy nowadays to overlook
 nice moments like the clarinet solos on be a part of it
 but the experimentation on this album almost seems de
 rigueur and the inventiveness doesnt convey any
 excitement
 
 the more straightforward songs are also a little limp the
 breezy indie pop of fortunesized and mandatory highsteppers
 has been done better elsewhere and the classic rock material
 odessa which could have come straight off workingmans
 dead or the cover of van morrisons precious time
 doesnt have the sharp vocals or crunchy guitar strumming that
 the style requires the leels let loose near the end trying
 to milk a rock crescendo from the song sailing sister but
 between the lethargic vocals and the somewhat muffled guitar
 line it never takes off listening to it is like watching a
 threelegged dog jump for a frisbee
 
 the chorus of sailing sister also demonstrates the bands
 biggest weakness the singing and especially the harmonies
 on songs like odessa the vocals are indistinct and whiny
 and they warble out of pitch the harmony parts are offkilter
 and painful many vocalists including the lips wayne coyne
 turn out great performances with arguably weak pipes and
 the leels have a resemblance to some other vocal antiheroes
 such as neil young or jerry garcia however singers like
 these show more personality
 
 the leels arent as expressive
 sometimes they sound like theyre singing from the living
 room couch and other times they use too much ironic detachment
 on closer to be morrison cant even get a rise out of the
 word piss and the lyrics about his nonstatus as a rock
 star arent as knowing or funny as they want to be we know
 the star is someone that ill call yours truly its time to
 admit that i am the shit or else ima get unruly even a
 breezy laid back album like this should sound like it could
 really put up a fightthere are a lot of ways that music can be beautiful a lot of
 times we hear something as pretty simply because were
 conditioned that way frequently beauty and grandeur are the
 result of careful planning and composing like samuel barbers
 adagio for strings or vivaldis summer violin concerto i
 suppose there are certain cliches that have emerged in western
 music as its gradually become codified into a system of keys
 and chords and standard arrangements that weve collectively
 come to view as ugly and beautiful the way we listen to
 music is defined by our cultural surroundings and our
 surroundings tell us that minor keys are sad and major keys
 are happy generally speaking
 
 on the other end of the spectrum theres a different kind of
 beauty to found in less strictly composed more freeflowing
 music you can hear it in shuggie otis freedom flight
 or the first track on boredoms vision creation newsun
 theres a certain point where some improvised music suddenly
 ceases to be subject to pretense its just there and you
 take it for what it is on a personal level i think this is
 why i find listening to japanese koto music and javanese gamelan
 orchestras to be somewhat liberating somewhere in all that
 sound you can catch a rather vivid glimpse of the soul of the
 person or people playing it
 
 naturally i enjoy both music thats intricately composed and
 music thats totally free of any compositional guidance a
 feather in the engine david kilgours fourth solo album
 excluding his mid90s compilation of demos first steps
 and false alarms plays something like a meeting point
 between the two ends of the spectrum on the one hand you
 have several smartly written psychedelic pop songs ensconced
 in the traditions of kiwi rock that kilgours own band the
 clean helped establish on the other you have a handful of
 simply gorgeous offthecuff guitar instrumentals that
 transcend any other little subgenre distinctions you could
 apply to kilgours music
 
 the album opens with one of these instrumentals a meandering
 meditative track called sept 98 that makes me want to get
 out a good throw rug find a mantra and have a good moment of
 escape from my oftoverbearing superego kilgours guitar
 lines seem to flow with his stream of consciousness and the
 several overdubbed parts combine for a shimmer effect an
 unassuming organ interjects now and then with quasimelodic
 phrases that provide a good contrast to the simple themes
 kilgour works out on his guitar one urgently strummed
 passage even recalls jorma kaukonens embryonic journey
 from jefferson airplanes surrealistic pillow
 
 the album moves from there to the quirky pastoral psychpop
 of slippery slide full of tumbling piano flourishes
 percussive plucked bass and relaxed acoustic strumming
 kilgours singing isnt exactly what youd call worldclass
 but his subdued tenor works just about perfectly for this kind
 of thing all the rest follows with a more focused pop hook
 and a strong backbeat kilgour doesnt pay much mind to
 traditional pop song structure in his writing though and
 this songs is no exception as he lays into his wah pedal for
 an extended midsection that provides the record with one of
 its cleanest moments
 
 several other songs follow fairly wellpaved paths such as
 the fine acoustic the perfect watch or wooden shed but
 the three best songs come consecutively near the end today
 is gonna be mine is an exultant blast of prime flying nun
 brand pop ramshackle yet somehow also propulsive i caught
 you opens with a venus in furs drone some repetitive piano
 motives and a detached kilgour singing ive got you inside
 my head before cutting into a slippery bass groove courtesy
 of frequent kilgour collaborator noel ward over thumping drums
 
 instra 2 reprise follows and though its title may make it
 sound like a tossedoff interlude its anything but kilgour
 delivers one of his best vocal performances over subtle
 percussion wahdrenched guitar and a string arrangement by
 graeme downes of the verlaines the string quartet is
 masterfully scored to provide counterpoint to kilgours vocals
 during verses and melodic material between the verses brief
 easternsounding descending lines alternate with copelandesque
 crescendos with a swooping violin lead its truly fantastic
 stuff that succeeds brilliantly without really conforming to
 any traditional sense of structure
 
 of course there are also more of those splendid little
 instrumentals to be found like instra 2 an acoustic 12
 string guitar and tack piano interlude obviously influenced
 by the music of south asia kilgour rattles off sitarlike
 runs with ease and keeps the harmony ambiguous the album
 closes with backwards forwards which centers all of its
 varied wandering around a few central chords relying on a
 simple cadence to bring everything full circle at regular
 intervals a distant drum machine provides a pace for the
 proceedings which find kilgour alternately exploring textured
 strumming and slow surfstyled leads dripping in reverb
a feather in the wind is actually a bit too brief at 38
 minutes and youll barely feel the passage of time while
 listening to it complaints are hard to come by as theres
 really not a single unpleasant moment on the entire album
 that said though thoroughly enjoyable the album isnt always
 riveting either and occasionally the attention does stray
 but thats hardly a reason not to throw it on when you need
 to chill out after a long day now is it kilgour has managed
 to craft an album that unleashes a hefty dose of beauty on the
 world and thats something we can always useits just too damn easy to record and release an album these days
 i used to firmly believe that as technology made things easier quality would
 improve im not sure now how i ever came to hold this foolish belief maybe it
 was too much protech scifi as a kid or maybe a nave believe in the democratizing
 effects of computers that somehow was carried over into the realm of art at any
 rate the bottom line is i was wrong computer recording technology by making it
 essentially as easy to release a cd as it is to bathe your dog has only increased
 the amount of shit being put out lest there be any doubt go to any used bin in
 the country and as further proof i offer up this cd from nate denvers neck
 someone somewhere at some point in the whole process should have stopped this
 from ever reaching my desk whats being aimed at here presumably is a skewed
 childrens album of electrofolk interspersed with sound collages and spoken word
 field recordings a fairly admirable goal but the main problem is that its
 carried off in such a mindless fashion that prepare to die teeters from
 mildly annoying to completely unlistenable over the course of 39 tiring minutes
 the other main problem is that the album cant make up its mind whether it wants
 to be comedynovelty album or an album exploring deep philosophical questions
 the kind of questions that tend to come up amongst friends in a college dormitory
 at about the time the last cold brews are being sipped this lack of focus makes
 for an album thats neither very funny nor very intellectually penetrating
 there are a few cheap laughs like a muzaklike tribute to slayers raining blood
 and smashoptomus the story of a childhood toy come back for revenge after its
 owner grows up and locks it in the closet for years but at its best prepare
 to die sounds like a particularly uninspired ween jerkoff studio session the
 most perplexing thing is that the label which released this is run by none other
 than mick turner of the dirty three the marquis de tren himself whose music i
 love maybe he owed the guy a favor or something seriously mick lets have some
 standards herethe last songs ohia album i heard was ghost tropic that was the perfect
 name for its haunted postfolk what with the sharp guitar chords the percussion
 rumbling like uncontrollable spirits and jason molinas disconsolate wail but
 each of his works as songs ohia is a different beast taking shape around the
 group of musicians hes currently working with so i was a bit hesitant when i
 heard about the new album which was recorded in philadelphia with jim krewson
 and jennie benford of jim and jennie and the pinetops amongst other musicians
 i wanted more of the ghost tropic sound a fractured structure just this
 side of collapse but here they were recording songs live in one take with no
 overdubs and garnering comparisons to the warmth of the muscle shoals studio
 recordings during the 1970s
 within one listen didnt it rain convinced me that it was worth paying
 attention to its own terms songs ohias compositions have a strange way of
 warping time for the listener how else could the opening title track slip by me
 after nearly eight minutes it begins in a slow progression of acoustic chords
 and almost immediately molina is singing about the eye of the storm and those
 caught under its downpour the chorus wells up with trilling guitar notes and
 jennie benford providing backing vocals and molina warns if you think you got
 it theyre gonna beat it out of you through work and debt calling a recording
 intimate can be clich but i swear you can practically hear the floorboards
 creaking the song swells and sighs for minutes like a vintage neil young ballad
 until right near the end when molina asks the question in the song title
 i thought that didnt it rain might be more light of heart like some of
 the palace records songs ohia is often compared to in the previous song molina
 asks the group audibly to bring it back for another chorus and it doesnt detract
 from the music at all but it seems his tropical depression has lingered despite
 titles like steve albinis blues and cross the road molina the former lopes
 along deliberately the pace set by banjolike plinks and made more tense by the
 relative silence that pervades molina benford and krewson join together to sing
 see its sulfury shine see the big city moon tween the radio tower tween the
 big diesel rigs reviewers often mention molinas bluecollar background but
 im not going to try to prove anyones cred someone probably krewson howls
 the line see the big city moon again and the lastdime desperation in his
 twangy voice is authenticity enough
 theres a shared imagery that becomes evident especially on ring the bell and
 cross the road molina two songs in the middle of the album that flow together
 as a conceptual piece its here that molina might seem too far gone in gloom
 as he begs show us how bad were outnumbered but the compositions never reach
 the gormenghastly nature of apocalyptic folk groups like death in june theres
 a bleak beauty in the arc of the amped electric strings and when the chicago moon
 swings like a blade molina may even be painting himself as the andalusian dog
 you can trace the lyrical themes light darkness the moon fire chicago those
 themes are evoked again on two blue lights a brief blues piece about the light
 from a bus and the moon about hell and your hometown is it the scraping sounds
 of the frets that make it so earthy and uplifting
 ill throw my cards down now blue factory flame is a classic drumkit
 percussion enters for the first time setting a steady 44 frame as molina asks
 when i die put my bones in an empty street bring a coleman lantern and a radio
 a cleveland game and a fishing pole the blackhearted procession continues as
 he describes ghostly iron ore ships coming home and climaxes in the refrain
 paralyzed by emptiness its as apt a summary of depressions effects as ive
 heard and the electric guitar emits a stark weathered sort of sadness
 musically blue chicago moon evokes more of that aged rust belt atmosphere but
 molina admits that youre not helpless when youre hunted by the blues and he
 calls out over and over for you to try to beat it try to beat it from the
 first song it seems that didnt it rain is intended as a bulwark against
 sorrow and that commitment appears again on this last track the compositions
 here are elemental filled with flame as well as steel and stone and they tie
 molinas native ohio together with his current home chicago in the process of
 recording another incredible album hes discovered that light is most visible
 when its flickering alone in the darktheres a saying my family has been trying to teach me for years about people who
 dont talk often it goes something like people listen to other people who dont
 talk often or something to that effect but with far more pith whatever the
 pithy saying is however im certain it applies with great vigor to music
 pitchfork spews like old faithful on just about every subgenre on earth and as
 evidenced by our vitriolic reader mail section you take ample liberty to pronounce
 us full of living shit there is one genre however on which you remain notably
 silent this genre is hiphop
 
 although your silence could be attributed to soulfree apathy it appears from the
 empirical data that its something else entirely an unquestioning irrational
 trust of pitchfork hiphop recommendations and a validation of that great classic
 saying whatever that saying in fact is you see we dont often write about
 hiphop but when we do you respond by opening your wallets i offer as proof
 two examples both released in 2001 cannibal oxs the cold vein and aesop
 rocks labor days if you didnt buy them you know you went out of your
 way to hear them and none of you had the balls to say an ill word like lemmings
 you follow
 
 while you may be our lemmings and full disclosure we were far from the first
 publication to go off about those records we are undoubtedly def juxs bitch
 aesop rock and cannibal ox both pillars of the label could tell you that our
 fidelity aside though def jux really is doing one hell of a job its rare that
 you get one joint as good as the cold vein or labor days in any
 given year to have two and both on the same label is something close to a minor
 miracle so its on the heels of this success that def jux understandably desires
 to garner some exposure for the rest of their cast their latest compilation
 definitive jux presents ii puts several new faces in the spotlight with
 above average results stopping a few steps short of greatness
 
 if def jux could be defined by any single musical element it would be the beats
 the beats on djp2 are dark jagged and intriguing and not a single one
 of them could in any way be deemed danceable subway beats sewer beats these
 ones reek of the underground the best beat comes early on the albums first
 track same as it never was by the weathermen featuring elp vast aire cage
 and mhz among others employing an ordinary breakbeat the songs verses are
 fueled by a repetitive threechord key progression that sounds like a cross
 between an accordion and a fender rhodes the chorus choppily and spastically
 misquotes the talking heads over a springy oscillating scifi sample all
 together its got an snarling offkilter funk real nice
 
 aesop shows up with a grimace and a solid set of rhymes on dead pan declaring
 in the chorus no im not feeling all right imagine aesop in a fussy bad mood
 and youve got a handle on this track drink a bad glass of gumption not bad
 meaning bad but bad meaning disgusting hold the floor features a rough
 headnodding beat and a solid battle from mhz now goin against me and thinking
 you aint gonna die is like skinny dippin in hell thinking you aint gonna
 fry producer rjd2 does enough on the instrumental i really like your def jux
 tee baby to live up to the rep he gained with the heralded 2001 12inch june
 his beat on the comp visits the same emotions as the rest on djp2 but with
 a little less grit and a little more grace like strings samples
 
 again pitchfork has spoken this time though weve been let loose from our def
 jux leash djp2 is quite good but not great if youre a big hiphop fan
 youll want this and as an intro to the depths of the label it aint half bad
 but if youre close to filling your threehiphopalbumsperyear quota id save
 your money for another def jux artist debut and another pitchfork orgasmi want to love the brian jonestown massacre i really do but no matter how hard
 i try i just cant dont get me wrong theyve got some great songs but they
 never quite hit me the way i want them to it took some serious effort for me to
 even like them as much as i do why would i possibly put forth so much effort to
 like a random band you ask no reason im just funny that way but seriously
 i heard strung out in heaven for the first time back in 98 or so and
 thought wow thats disappointing see you cant just put the word massacre
 after your name and not expect people to have some lofty expectations
 
 for whatever reason i found myself drawn back to the disc a few months later and
 was still less than impressed it really wasnt until id kinda forgotten about
 them and rediscovered them last year that i finally admitted that strung out
 in heaven was a good record so when i picked up bravery repetition and
 noise i figured it was now then or never this was their last chance to
 either impress me or convince me to give up and what do those assholes do
 they go and make a record thats so righteously mediocre that im back where i
 started talk about a kick in the teeth shit
 
 to the bands credit the album starts off pretty good in fact the upbeat yet
 somber second track telegram is one of the best songs ive heard from them
 but rest of the album never even comes close reaching that level though not for
 lack of trying sailor is a great psychedelic song with layered vocal harmonies
 and fuzz guitar that sounds reminiscent of headera monkees open heart
 surgery juxtaposes a simple haunting guitar lead in the foreground with a droning
 organ in the back to great success and i might add the vocals really remind me
 of robert smith and therefore the whole thing recalls late80s cure think
 disintegration and since ive reviewed this thing all out of order so
 far let me just say that the first song just for today is really good too
 
 unfortunately the rest falls flat individually the songs arent bad but the
 album as a whole is awfully forgettable it all just kinda runs together and
 becomes background music rock thats accidentally ambient one of the low
 points comes with let me stand next to your flower which features not only a
 stupid title but also an intro consisting of stringed instruments odd random
 voices and the sound of someone logging onto the internet thats so 1997 guys
 can you say revolution 9 yeah i thought you could and its only downhill
 from there
 
 were this album simply a sixsong ep consisting of the first six tracks it could
 be really great of course thats not how it went down and as an album
 bravery repetition and noise just doesnt cut it the weird thing is
 that one of the songs is even on here twice they couldve left off the if i
 love you new european gold standard secret babylonian brotherhood cinema mix
 trimmed the fat a little and had a damn fine release instead we get if i
 love you new european gold standard secret babylonian brotherhood cinema mix
 in all its obnoxious unglory weighting the record down with its unspeakable
 pointlessness
 
 and whats with that eurotrash accent who does anton newcombe think he is
 madonna i mean fucktatsuya yoshida is somewhere in japan right now and you can bet hes got visions
 of sugarplum zeuhl demons dancing in his head its worse for him than you might
 think while most of us were engrossed in real stereophonic performances of fun
 house or radio city yoshida must have been burning to play on the same
 stage or in some way act on his own theatric instincts to create rock music that
 would defy the tradition laid out by a million critics worshipping chuck berry and
 the stones and then came punk but not long after the year punk broke all the
 drama you whiled away in became uncool and pretentious so you and yoshida had a
 stalemate right how do you reconcile rock attitude punk apathy and prog well
 strangeness
 
 enter ruins a drumsnbass duo who played harder than most and screamed better
 than anyone you knew and not least importantly they had their magma riffs down
 this was not prog mind you and it certainly wasnt punk imagine paul simonon
 trying to play graviyaunosch yikes but it has more indie cred than both
 put together i mean whats more alternative than playing a fivestring bass
 while yodeling in a madeup language one actually based on another madeup
 language and recording your commercial album with steve albini ill just come
 out and say it this is not for everyone but yoshida has gotten around this pesky
 gap between the genres by compartmentalizing his music he has projects that deal
 exclusively with group improvisation some that deal with noise a couple of
 really good allinstrumental punkprog bands and koenjihyakkei koenji is a
 unique concept for yoshida and it may go down as his greatest achievement the
 most perfect fusion of straight prog the avantgarde and hardcore punk amen
 
 this is koenjis third album and for the record its even more overtly proggy
 than the first two former vocalist aki kubota left the band and for any of you
 who thought she was irreplaceable youre only half right oguchi kenichi easily
 fulfills her old role as keyboardist and much of the music seems to have been
 written to suit his strengths and new vocalist samara name certainly has the
 vocal chops to pull off more than her fair share of theatrics the biggest losses
 here are kubotas compositions which were always among the bands most colorful
 particularly given yoshidas propensity to dominate the proceedings with the
 vocalistwriterdrummer trisect she will be missed but even if the direction
 has changed slightly the enthusiasm has not
 
 on nivraym theres a newfound emphasis on keyboard textures and a whole
 new bag of solo breaks the other koenji albums stood out from the pack for any
 number of reasons but particularly in their lack of flashy improv here kenichi
 gets in his licks and then some similar to ruins symphonica unusual for
 the group with added singers and keyboards on which he impractically stole the
 show in fact much of this album reminds of symphonica also due to a
 slightly lighter sound than its predecessors its no cakewalk but its not quite
 the overloaded powder keg of 1997s ii either this suits the synths as
 well as the vocal lines which are ever closer to that hallowed qualifier of lore
 known as almost normal
 
 but normal is relative of course and here it refers mostly to magmas zeuhl
 heritage and the occasional dramatic soprano lead instrumentally the band
 plays fairly close to hardedged rock in opposition sound theres a lot of
 traditional avantprog to this music with very complex instrumental counterpoint
 and a kind of playful attitude to experimentation but the abrasive elements bring
 it closer to the postmodern of old newschoolers like john zorn and mr bungle
 overall nivraym is more refined and none the cornier for it
 
 one of the great things about this record and this kind of stuff in general is
 that it seems such a glorious reaction to the great records of the past rather
 than indebted to them put simply nivraym is one of the better records i
 heard in 2001 its fun challenging and youll learn a lot no wait thats
 school try this its fun challenging and will kick your ass all the way back
 to wednesday yeah that sounds rightsome bands just need a producer these days when just about anyone can buy some
 recording equipment and make a halfway decent sounding album a lot of bands seem
 to think they can get away with doing everything themselves some of them are
 right of course and a lot of selfproduced bands churn out some amazing work
 but most of these bands are frankly kidding themselves
 
 case in point the waking eyes who at some point decided it would for the best
 if they produced their own debut record combing the clouds perhaps it
 was merely a practical matter producers can be expensive of course or perhaps
 they had other motives but whatever the reason its clear from listening to the
 album that the band could stand an outside voice informing their creative projects
 
 featuring past members of the pets and novillero the waking eyes arent exactly
 dewyeyed newcomers and it shows in the songwriting the band writes solid
 melodies backed by imaginative progressions and arrangement ideas the primary
 problems lie in its execution sonically speaking combing the clouds is a
 48minute stroll through a musical used car lot full of sounds bought back wholesale
 from the 70s and very late 60s
 
 the band piles on affectations and vintagesounding instruments to the point where
 it becomes hard to see the songs for the clever compositions they are this is
 where a producer could come in very handy someone a little less attached to the
 music could easily point out the fat in these songs and convince the band that
 some trimming is needed to make it more digestible a set of outside ears at the
 very least an experienced engineer could also have done wonders for this record
 simply by making the mix more vibrant frequently the album simply sounds dull
 in the places where its vital that it hook you
 
 take the two ballads nestled at tracks four and five castle by the bay and
 gone with a glance castle by the bay features a nice horn arrangement a
 good melody and some fine group vocals but virtually no sense of discretion in
 placing all of those elements together the bass and keyboards bleed together
 and the horns play in the background as though someone turned on a radio during
 the recording session the vocals are recorded in such a way that they manage to
 fade into the music as though they were just another element in a sonic wallpaper
 pattern
 
 gone with a glance suffers similar problems at first beginning as a simple
 piano ballad before adding a rhythm section and a terrible synthesized string
 patch the second verse finds the vocals struggling to be heard above a wandering
 wholly unnecessary clarinet part after the leaden second chorus the song
 suddenly mutates into a poorly realized queen tribute complete with heavily
 overdubbed vocals and brian maystyle harmonized guitar leads the dramatic
 effect that queen managed to achieve with that sound however is lost completely
 in the muddled mix the guitar quickly sinks below everything else and the
 choir never comes to the fore at all
 
 other songs show promise but get lost in their affectations like the psychedelic
 new rising sun a creamy ball of fuzz packed with organ that could be called
 doorsy though a more accurate comparison might be smash mouth the breakdown is
 a somewhat interesting section dominated by percussion and tape effects but even
 thats pretty muddy sounding the world its alive has some nice easygoing
 rhythms and a neat tejano horn section but the great tune is lost in a clutter
 of noise and hyperactive keyboards
 
 tergo velum is actually a great song with a yearning melody and some fine
 backing harmonies but once again the band doesnt seem to know when to stop
 adding things to the mix what could be a striking acoustic song is drowned in
 inconsequential little squiggles and unnecessary violin and clarinet noodling
 make a sound follows with yet another fine melody this time delivered a bit
 more effectively unfortunately the horn arrangement is lost under the rest of
 the instruments but the various sections of the song segue rather nicely together
 theres even one of those moments that makes you look around the room for the
 source of a sound as a watch alarm goes off right at the end of the second
 chorus its a fun little addition that just might send you to the back button
 to make sure that it was actually on the record and not somewhere in your house
 
 a few other songs work reasonably well such as the opener combs for the clouds
 with its fine harmonies elastic bassline and relatively uncluttered production
 anytime is similarly modest in its trappings and delivers the albums strongest
 hook to boot granted even this song suffers from some unfocused moments such
 as the short passage before the third verse but by and large its a decent song
 that allows its melody to shine appropriately
 
 also surprisingly successful is sunday morning blues fully delivering on its
 title the band transitions from lofi acoustic blues straight into a healthy
 electric shuffle featuring some impressive dirty guitar leads the organ is
 obviously not a real hammond instead emitting a rather weak tone that unfortunately
 makes the arrangement sound bit thin but the band makes up for it with a good
 feel and some astounding lead guitar work a rocking midsection and an oddball
 circus music interlude dont contribute much to the song but they dont detract
 much from it either and on this album thats basically all you can ask for
 
 but sunday morning blues also illustrates some of the most frustrating things
 about the waking eyes obviously theyre very talented musicians and fine
 songwriters as well they rotate vocals and instruments with aplomb rarely
 failing to deliver a competent performance however their tendency to get
 carried away during recording is ultimately too much for their considerable skills
 to handle and the album fails to make much of an impact to bring things full
 circle a little bit of outside input might be all this band needs to work their
 way up into the 80 realm heres hoping they get it on future effortsi have a dream in that dream there are no names for music music just is you
 heard me no country no rock no rap polka classical or experimental and
 certainly in this dream there is no such thing as electronic music see one
 thing ive never really understood is contemporary electronic musics apparent
 need to separate itself from the rest of the worlds music the insistence of
 putting the word electronic in front of the word music draws a line that
 neednt exist frightening away potential listeners and setting in motion certain
 unnecessary presumptions distinctions as simple as electronic music assume a
 music thats simple too and while simple is hardly a term that fits much of
 todays music far too often electronic music is
 half a century ago things were different visionaries like luciano berio and edgar
 varese saw electronics as part of the greater picture littering their avantgarde
 compositions with sounds both natural and computerborne they juxtaposed the
 natural and the synthetic along the way posing the question as to just how far
 removed these sounds even were from one another
 but since the popularization of electronic music in the early 1990s its often
 seemed like weve taken a step back more often than not music is categorized as
 either electronic or otherwise there would seem to be no in between this tendency
 to segregate two perfectly compatible styles of music continues to baffle me and
 apparently im not alone as evidenced by radioheads recent steps toward the
 abstract mouse on mars electroacoustic grooves and recent works by cex the
 shalabi effect and mm all of which have made use of both electronics and real
 instruments the general populace is growing more comfortable with the idea of
 blurring this line
 its this willingness to cross needless genre lines that saves david edwards solo
 electronic project minotaur shock from the void of idm anonymity chiffchaffs
 and willow warblers opens ordinarily enough morphing beats chopped up sounds
 smooth synth textures your average student of the morr music school for pretty
 idm is it nicesounding yup well produced uhhuh enjoyable sure
 memorable well lets put it this way turn it on in a room full of people
 no ones liable to complain though it seems unlikely anyone will give it a second
 thought but watch those heads turn the very moment a simply strummed acoustic
 guitar is dropped into the mix on the third track first to back down marvel
 at the way a sampled trumpet brings the beats grinding to a halt and breathes new
 life into moray arrival the addition of glockenspiel recorder vibraphone
 and a slew of other acoustic instruments lifts this release from the pits of
 mediocrity
 granted there are solid electronically produced moments too the range infuses
 typical chicagostyle postrock with minimal glitchhouse loops deconstructing a
 mccombsian bassline held over from the prior track dicing it bouncing the results
 from speaker to speaker in time with the music while synthesized vibraphone and
 melodica flavors the track on out of the hot a gentle synth backdrop makes
 for great contrast with the garbled beats and piercing atari melodies
 still the best moments here are those that infuse the mechanical with the organic
 like the reprisal of the aforementioned atari melody later in the album voiced
 this time instead by a bunch of string instruments or local violin shop which
 opens with a basic repeated rhodes keyboard figure before adding an acoustic guitar
 and static beeping followed by live nonprocessed drums it proceeds for about a
 minute as an acoustic rock number before you realize that youre no longer hearing
 guitar but rather guitar loops soon all natural sound but the drums have dropped
 out only to be replaced by an explosion of digitally processed keyboard and guitar
 sounds get layered upon one another it becomes impossible to tell whats processed
 and whats not theres an escalation a climax and a return to the simple acoustic
 instruments with which the track began its an amazing song from start to finish
chiffchaffs and willow warblers has its fair share of such moments but not
 quite enough to put it in the same class as similar artists like mm or isan of
 course if this sort of gentlebeatdriven thing is your bag its unlikely youll
 find much to argue with here edwards would do well to stick to his guns and add
 even more acoustic toys to the mix on future attempts without a doubt his liberal
 use of such instrumentation is refreshing not to mention a step in the direction
 of an emancipated musical utopia where no one is bound by restrictive genrenames
 and where sounds interact any which way they damned well pleasehistory has seen many important summits bringing together some of the worlds most
 powerful men who could forget the historic 1972 meeting of richard nixon and
 chairman mao in beijing or the tense cold war rendezvous between jfk and nikolai
 khruschchev back in 61 even recently weve seen george bush i spraying his
 lunch all over the japanese prime minister and vladimir putin chopping wood with
 gdubs at the western white house
 well guess what indie rockers now we have our very own version of a presidential
 summit an albumlength collaboration from prolific boozehound robert pollard and
 the formerly hyperenough mac mccaughan okay so maybe the analogy is a little
 ridiculous as pollard and mccaughan arent brokering any arms treaties between
 dayton and chapel hill on calling zero but the project does reflect one
 key feature of most political summits in that theres a whole lot of pomp and
 circumstance but not much in the way of substantial results
calling zero is the nineteenth album in pollards fading captain series
 king shits wildly inconsistent quest to build up a solo catalog of merzboxlike
 scope and like many recent releases from the series the album utilizes pollards
 favorite trick of late soliciting instrumental tracks from friends and overdubbing
 liberal amounts of his trademark arenarockinacan vocals here for the first
 time he goes outside the very extended guided by voices family to choose superchunk
 frontman mccaughan as a collaborator
 it sounds like the wet dream of a mid90s college radio dj but unfortunately
 go back snowballs total does not add up to the sum of its individual parts
 if like me you prayed that mccaughan would steer pollard out of the increasingly
 clichd slump hes been in since the heyday of the classic dayton lineup well
 keep on prayin mccaughans poppish ways and newfound restraint would seem to
 fill the gap that tobin sprouts departure has left in recent gbv work but like
 the similarconcept airport 5 albums with sprout the songs here sound largely
 halfbaked and awkwardly constructed
 for this failure i blame the device its hard to fault mccaughan who
 responsible for all the instrumentation on calling zero submits a number
 of interesting musical ideas in the lighter vein of the last two superchunk albums
 prominently using old keyboards and budget electronics a number of tracks climb
 throat of throats have a distinctly stephen merrittesque sound while radical
 girl and dumbluck systems storefront smartly incorporate brass sections
 but these airy constructions sound tailored to the fragile high voice of mccaughan
 not the cockrock swagger of pollard try to imagine uncle bob singing heres
 to shutting ups latecentury dream and youll get the idea even when
 mccaughan cranks up the old distortion pedal on lifetime for the mavericks the
 highflying vocals sound strangely out of place
 mavericks also supplies an excellent example of the other problem plaguing
 calling zero the excessively thin and demolike sound in many cases
 the songs would be improved greatly by the strident drumming of superchunks jon
 wurster or the bassplaying of well anybody since theres hardly any lowend
 to be found a more lofi approach mightve covered up these omissions as well
 with the tape hiss of old gbv warming up the sparse decor but the overly slick
 sound only highlights the shortcomings
 as such calling zero is far too entrenched in the middle not playing
 enough to pollards opposing strengths of microphoneswinging rock or fourtrack
 experimentalism the bright spots i am divine the title track suggest a
 certain amount of chemistry between the quasifamous duo but the slapdash feel
 of the rest make one wonder if a facetoface interaction wouldve been more
 rewarding than this collaborationbymail im sorry to report well all have to
 continuing waiting for indierocks answer to the powerful jayzr kelly alliance
 the best of both worlds babysome great bands will just never be quite as great as you want them to be
 there are loads and loads of reasons this can happen but when it comes to indie
 music its usually because they arent trying and so like a basementdwelling
 stoners gainfully employed girlfriend you sit around loving them deeply not
 wanting to criticize but knowing they could do great things if theyd only give
 it an honest shot
 sometimes i think i feel that way about vitesse heres the deal they released
 two gorgeous records before this one both revolve around serious mining of
 earlytomid80s british rainyday indie and synthpop new order electronic
 early depeche mode omd which is to say that they consist of moody pop songs
 constructed from sweepybleepy synth programming shimmery guitar arpeggios and
 dour bittersweet crooning they also fall pretty squarely into the whole
 bedroomindie aesthetic meaning that these records sound well bedroomy
 intimate a little lofi and a little bit rigged with duct tape ill discuss
 stephin merritt momentarily the first vitesse record was called a certain
 hostility and it was great all twinkly synths and sleepy melodies and an
 absolute swooner of a track called a fine young age most of it fell closer to
 holidayera magnetic fields than those commonancestor brits the second
 record was called chelsea 27099 and not only was it great but it signified
 a slight attitude shift same rainy days but suddenly the synths were colder and
 buzzier the drum machines more booming suspicious squints all over the vocals
 i and full disclosure the i here is shamelessly devoted to moody early80s
 brit indie the i lives for it couldnt wait for vitesse to blossom
 theres nothing massively interesting about hearing synthy stuff
 bedroomstyle its charming as hell for a couple records but heres the thing
 i believe in vitesse they sound fabulous and sometimes their songwriting
 is as spoton as i could possibly ask for so i wanted to hear these synth
 symphonies writ large i wanted to see them chuck the comfy sweaters and
 bedheads and get all slicked up and flashy in beautiful suits i wanted to hear
 them top my favorites homeless club kids incredibly stiff competition in this
 milieu or put a pop challenge to the hifi electro grcooves of felix da housecat
 and adult i wanted ambition which is why what can not be but is
 is slightly painful to me its lovely really as adorable as either of the last
 two records maybe less depending the songs here seem a tad weaker than before
 but close anyway it skims and pulses along on hihats and synth pads and peter
 hook riffs and wispy vocals as sweetly and melodically as anything else theyve
 done which you can probably tell is sort of my problem
 need i mention the guilt involved in being dissatisfied with something i enjoy so
 much but there you have it this record contains eight vitessepenned tracks that
 if i didnt like them i would likely call rehashed plus two covers omds 2nd
 thought and bruce springsteens unsatisfied heart the first of which pleases
 with its immaculate new orderisms and the latter of which slots surprisingly well
 into the stephin merrittish sound theyre sliding back toward the rest swoons
 pleasantly enough
 theyre probably content this way unambitiously sending out solid bedroom
 communiqus every year or two probably they have other things theyre busy with
 josh klein writes for the onion and i imagine hewson chen has something
 stimulating to do growing up in america listening to posh british synthindie
 used to be a pretty surefire way to wind up reading lots of books and university
 of chicago grads do okay in the job market kleins never really dug into a band
 anyway he played drums on the first toulouse record which was similarly great
 enough that you wished theyd taken on more and did a similar bowout from aden
 about whom ditto a certain hostility was supposedly recorded in 36 hours
 and it doesnt sound as if theyve started clearing second weekends for
 their projects exactly how fortunate are we that david grubbs is the only
 university of chicago guy who thinks big must i really be the high school english
 teacher who explains that she only grades them down because she can see that they
 have more potential than that
 strip away my fretting though a simpler way of saying all of this is that if you
 like the magnetic fields holiday or the 6ths wasps nest or even
 orange cake mix while were at it you should buy some vitesse records immediately
 hopefully youll never face the day when you realize youre going to stop caring
 about new ones if theyre not going to show some commitment a different simple
 way of saying this is just to quote hewson chen from starlight sometimes
 youve just got to try a little hardereardrums primary partnership of lou cicotelli and richard baker have been
 providing jazzbo hipsters with high concept drumcircle tracks since 1996
 cicotelli has also given up some loend theory for postmodern primitives pram
 and laika but those acts never gave him the freedom to realize his afrobeatonsaturn
 rhythmic abstractions
 
 performing live and then editing the tracks in a teo macerolike manner eardrum
 hope to preserve the spontaneity of live performance and to shape their jams
 into something far greater than the sum of its individual parts but despite
 their noble intentions eardrum only partially succeed side effects is
 an enormous canvas upon which eardrum and a legion of guest percussionists have
 painted fragments of rhythm the risk that eardrum run is that the album could
 be too thickly layered to make any headway through and indeed the bands
 gamble never fully pays off
side effects is not mere smog its hardening concrete a shame because
 cicotelli and baker and their guests jason yarde of j life yoruba jazz
 people and manu dibango folasade barbarinde of adzido pan african dance and
 drum ensemble gary jeff of mass god and scalpel nii tagoe of adzido
 frititi and african head charge nana tsiboe of dade krama moire drum
 orchestra and trouble dat and laikas guy fixsen are really quite competent
 as musicians its just that the music is impenetrable
 
 perhaps my concern about side effects is due to my limited exposure to
 avantgarde percussion albums sure ive enjoyed evelyn glennies
 conservatoirejunglist album shadow behind the iron sun and done a
 lifetimes worth of watusis to toby dammits top dollar but eardrums
 milesonmars remix of sofa surfers guns n bombs n knives still bugs me
 out whenever i hear it so i concede that i may be at fault nonetheless let
 me outline my misgivings
 
 the biggest problem i see with side effects is that the individual tracks
 have little for me to latch onto with the exception of a few select tracks
 sandblasted with its sax squalls and insistent bass rhythms sounds as though
 eardrum have captured the master musicians of jajouka and promised their release
 provided the guys make a monstrous enough racket two strangers accompanied
 by imade iyamus chants allows guy fixsens moog to squiggle and farp
 trickster tale sends sun ras arkestra on an echoedout journey beyond the
 orbit of neptune the relentless bass boom and cowbellish tones of bone room
 could serve as the basis for a megaton techno animal doom rap track the
 gloriously sullied escape from evil traps chics wikkywikky guitar sound and
 uses it as a birch to whip the devoidoffunk
 
 however too many tracks such as family mask the album opener remain
 impenetrable as their percussive resilience balks at comprehension ive even
 tried to listen to family mask as wallpaper but to little success i really
 want to engage with the apocalyptic voodoo madness within but maybe im just not
 skilled or pure enough to be granted entry i doubt very much that eardrum are
 expecting huge sales for side effects although some occasionally
 eclectic djs might want a copy as an exotic tool to break up their sets with
 side effects uncompromising murkiness is likely to prevent all but the
 most devoted from enjoying itwhy wouldnt you take mira calix seriously granted her work generally sees
 favorable reviews but ive seen a lot of offhand comments from idm kids who
 dismiss her because she used to work as press secretary for warp its clear even
 from her small discography as dj and composer that chantal passamonte isnt trying
 to be the female aphex twin regardless of how many have made that comparison
 richard james mike paradinas co camp out in what rephlex has come to call the
 braindance tradition their brand of cerebral mindfuckery passamontes 2000
 release one on one expressed an almost obsessive attention to sonic
 contiguity the result being a hypersensual world of sound that flowed in its own
 mysterious patterns her use of soft whispered vocals also added a level of
 intimacy not often found with the lads mentioned above
prickle followed as an ep in may of 2001 if the review is a bit late
 please forgive ive been lost in the 19minute opening track its never given
 the name prickle but rather is subdivided into four suites the first
 miliaria is named appropriately in that mili and ia both suggest
 unquantifiable vastness static flutters out of your headphones and other
 phenomena mill about in the periphery a sense of scale develops as a dense hiss
 rises above like a synthetic stormcloud brief melancholy piano phrases give
 form to the mix followed by thumping beats that remind of posthumans debut
 passamontes wispy singing tempers the cold swells of the keyboard echoing
 beautifully
 
 after roughly eight minutes that movement fades and the human touch is subsumed
 into alien environs populated by glitchy chirps and analogue squirts right around
 this point i lose what little footing i had thudding percussion reverberates
 under avian quibbling threatening to turn my walk home into a safari im saved
 by biomechanical crackling an oblique machinerhythm of some sort that brings me
 back from the veldt the album sleeve features childlike sketches of flora and
 fauna set amongst an expansive plain together with the music its a fitting
 evocation of mira calix south african homeland by way of londons sound if you
 cant be at home might as well take a little world with you
 
 the second and final track is a remix of one on ones skin with me
 courtesy of andrea parker as might be imagined its got an electro vibe
 framed by that light tchak hit on the fourth beat and fleshed out by anthemic
 synth vamps parker loops a fragment of passamontes voice for the main melodic
 line very similar in result to mobys retooling of the smashing pumpkins 1979
 in which he isolated that wibbling tweeee effect and slowed it to an unsettling
 speed building up his own song around the sample its the kind of piece thats
 danceable but difficult to imagine on a dancefloor youd have more luck with it
 as a choreograph routine for that diva from the fifth element the remix
 works as a nice coda for passamontes opusinmicrocosmthe best psychedelic music doesnt require the aid of pharmaceuticals
 
 the 13th floor elevators first album loves forever changes pink floyds
 piper at the gates of dawn and other such mindexpanding classics can get
 the job done on their own they dont need much outside help in the form of drugs
 or anything else for that matter the way i see it if an album needs drugs to
 make it enjoyable or emotionally moving then by definition its lacking
 something i dont think im being prudish when i say at its best psychedelic
 music should be a morethanadequate substitute for drugs if psychedelic music
 is simply music to take drugs to then the latest creed album is the most
 psychedelic album ever it makes me want to take drugs all of them as quickly
 as possible
 
 while nowhere near as accomplished as the above mentioned albums and not really
 sounding much like them either this second lp from a northern californian
 treesitting psychedelic ewokcumjohnfaheydisciple named ben chasny and
 his essentially one man acoustic droneraga outfit six organs of admittance
 certainly needs no lysergic crutch despite its outward trappings which might
 suggest otherwise
dark noontide is basically a tribalpsych album with acoustic guitar serving
 as the campfire around which flutes recorders tablas bells chimes and sundry
 other instruments dance its not a playful frolicking dance it has a somber and
 contemplative tone almost funereal at times three out of the eight songs also
 feature chasnys singing which is somewhat hard to pin down sometimes it sounds
 like a less operatic tim buckley maybe hard to imagine a gravelvoiced roger
 mcguinn or maybe skip spence still its nicely distinctive and perfectly
 matched to the musical accompaniment
 
 the album opens with the solemn blues of spirits abandoned with chasny singing
 the refrain i know what youve done what youve become with an almost zenlike
 detachment as if the subject of the song is just too overwhelming to be dealt
 with headon this hand mixes pseudoreligious lyrics with the best use of a
 buzzing guitar string since neil youngs ambulance blues while the album ends
 with a comparatively rockish tune called a thousand birds propelled by a
 driving acoustic guitar riff the song explodes into a distorted spastic
 electric guitar freakout ending the album in unexpected fashion given the
 loose meditative feel of what preceded it
 
 between these more songoriented pieces there are a couple of short solo
 acoustic numbers that many fahey fans would appreciate along with some other
 noisedrone improv pieces similar to the ones tower recordings have dedicated
 themselves to releasing on their own these tracks arent anything spectacular
 but as part of dark noontides expansive whole they have the ability to
 transport you to another world like few modernday psychedelic recordings can
 a kaleidoscopic hallucinatory experience all without the aid of drugs put that
 in your pipe and smoke itat any house party at any given time theres a person who has isolated himself
 in one of the rooms alone with a guitar sure theres a revolving fanbase whose
 ranks are refreshed by the evercirculating mass of people listening in hushed awe
 but the only constant is the guitar player and his is the loneliest of lives
 his music is considered a buzzkill as it generally reflects his disillusionment
 with the politics of the social world and will temporarily permeate the euphoric
 ambience of any who dare enter the room for a song somewhere along the way david
 bazan made the decision that life outside that room just wasnt worth the toll it
 took on the soul now he permanently resides there subtly sermonizing to any
 wholl listen
 
 throughout the course of pedro the lions career bazan has kept his arrangements
 relatively sparse and the only reason i feel secure certainly didnt make
 any attempt to break from that tradition upon its initial made in mexico release
 the ep comprised of five songs dealing with criticism of all things first
 introduced bazans selfdefeating love for conceptualist departure which would be
 fully realized on his 30minute opus winners never quit now that the band
 has jumped ship from made in mexico their back catalog is getting the jade tree
 treatment complete with repackaging and in the case of the only reason i feel
 secure the inclusion of a few bonus tracks though the eps rerelease
 certainly wont galvanize the industry it remains the definitive litmus test for
 those unfamiliar with pedros eitzelesque song structures and valiuminduced
 contemplations on life
 
 much fuss is unnecessarily made of bazans christian leanings luckily pedro the
 lion have always been reasonable lyrically speaking rather than openly addressing
 the christian god they opt to lament through ambiguity which occasionally yields
 some awkwardly worded sentiments still theres something disarming even from an
 objectivists standpoint about the disparity and wideeyed inquiry in lyrics like
 i hear that you dont change how do you expect to keep up with the trends you
 wont survive the information age this coupled with the somber arrangement of
 letter from a concerned follower makes for one of the discs better moments
 if not for former labelmate damien jurados similarly charred pipes and thematic
 offerings pedro the lion could easily escape on the potency of their lyrics
 however it seems that everything bazan tries to accomplish on the only reason
 has already been done before albeit better so if you consider yourself a fan of
 the lion do yourself a favor and go pick up jurados rehearsals for departure
 oh and pretty much anything by american music club
 
 expitchforker zach hooker gave the only reason i feel secure a slightly
 overwhelming 84 upon its initial release purism be damned but theres something
 that just doesnt bode well about an ep that boasts a whopping total of three new
 tracks one being a live interpretation of invention a song found earlier on
 the record a lyrics sheet and an inflated price the slightly abridged the
 only reason is still widely available and isnt nearly as much of a strain on
 your pocketbook both make for the perfect accompaniment to that 400am
 disillusionment that has occasionally claimed us all unfortunately such moments
 are few and far between and bazans output just doesnt sport the same underlying
 complexity as contemporaries red house painters will oldham and other such artists
 whose music is often denoted by meditations in the same mood
 
 pedro the lion hail from nathaniel hawthornes america this is what wayward
 puritans would headbang to satan has invariably given us greater musical gifts
 but for those introverts facing more exalted theological issues the only reason
 i feel secure fits like a tailored rosary of course life back then was stark
 and simple and the lion make no qualms about the utter incomplexity of their work
 though it cuts down on extraneous and unnecessary accompaniment it also makes for
 a complete lack of surprise when bazan unsheathes the old versechorusversechorusbridge
 formula song after song its funny though that emo a genre obviously begat by
 beelzebub himself finds so many of its contributions inspired by the word of godwho rocks the house the saxons rock the house and when the saxons rock the
 house they rock it all the way down langley high school cheerleading team
 
 not only were the langley saxon cheerleaders hot and slutty but they were also
 unwitting soothsayers who ever could have predicted that saxons of the future
 would so thoroughly rock the house but in the early 1990s they did as grunge
 exploded nationwide langleys auxiliary gym played host to a different sort of
 musical explosion the limitless pyrotechnic excitement of the battle of the bands
 at langley however each event seemed much less a battle than a small episode
 in a neverending war of the bands as fierce skirmishes of the bands seemed
 to break out almost every weekend usually on the same hotly contested turf and
 for the same rich 5000 bounty
 
 among the regulars in langleys war of the bands were stalwart cover artists spook
 jacobs whose flawless version of van halens jump was the weekly neutron bomb
 that obliterated all other contestants including appropriately enough ground
 zero featuring the powerful androgynous tenor of handsome dan sheridan
 there were also the king fahds with their indie flair underdog attitude and
 mediocre songwriting ability in true indie fashion the king fahds never won
 shit spook jacobs on the other hand won both shit and fame piling up
 victories well into the midtolate 90s one would have thought that at the
 minimum spook would be staring at a sweet recording deal by now but alas
 they had to settle for merely regional conquest
 
 of those not shamed into radioactive dust by the spooks atomic force were two
 graduates of langleys class of 1991 tim bracy and pete hoffman who undoubtedly
 remember all three bands and a parttime contributor to their band and likewise
 langley alum paul deppler as far as i know none of them ever enlisted in the
 war so much the better instead bracy and hoffman created their own musical
 insurgency an indie pop outfit known as the mendoza line
 
 now on their fourth lp the mendoza line has gained a reputation for rootsy
 melodydriven poprock that reputation certainly wont change with lost in
 revelry but as long as theyre being formulaic theyre doing a fine job
 the majority of the albums highlights come courtesy of the songwriting tandem
 of bracy and hoffman whose maturity as songsmiths is notable this record is
 consistently concise punchy and poignant
 
 the albums superb populist clapalong opener a damn good disguise stands out
 as the best song on the disc and is emblematic of the mendoza lines sound two
 parts westerberg one part wilco the band shifts into a lower gear for the triple
 bill of shame a raspy rustic tune that delivers a heap of emotion and a load
 of nifty rhymes and you were once of interest to the nightly news and the daily
 press but now that youve outlived your uselessness do you know what doesnt
 happen next they all call you by your number they wont call you by your name
 on the triple bill of shame
 
 mendoza compadre shannon mary mcardle doesnt fare quite as well mcardle who
 first appeared on 1999s i like you when youre not around plays a more
 prominent role on lost in revelry writing five songs for the album and
 singing lead vocals on each of them great as a backup vocalist mcardle could
 use a little help with the guitar and pen a few of her songs are decent red
 metal doors but others like the quasicountry of something dark and the
 snorealong im that the exclamation point is pure irony beg for the skip
 button
 
 long has the war laid dormant but the mendoza line has renewed their assault
 hoping that one day ultimate triumph will forge an era of peace between the
 bands unfortunately this assault while effective leaves them without complete
 victory the house while rocked still standsso it turns out this is a stonecold masterpiece who knew its been out of
 print for years but now that its back its being called everything from a
 good set of drinking songs to the seed that sprouted altcountry to the
 greatest rock album in history fear and whiskey was the first great
 statement of shambolic punk band the mekons and yes it is as great as all
 their rabid fans have always said though the greatest rock album in history
 is of course a bit of a stretch
 
 as i was digging through my rock library to figure out what defines a classic i
 found an essay by steve wynn of the dream syndicate listing his top criteria for
 what makes a great rock album the most important factor he argued was the
 potential of falling apart at any moment not just that the recording sounds
 rough around the edges but that the entire band could have careened off the
 rails at any time the mekons circa 1985 fit that description wonderfully
 though this album took months of planning fear and whiskey sounds as
 chaotic and spontaneous as any great night at a dance hall full of the reek of
 stale beer just like a live show almost all you can hear through the records
 tinny sound are steve gouldings drums pounding out a dance beat crossed with a
 military tattoo and susie honeymans fiddle soaring above pretty but ragged
 singerguitarists tom greenhalgh and jon langford bellow cheer and grumble
 through the noise they sing about booze they sing about politics and most of
 all they sing about despair greenhalgh opens chivalry with i was out late
 the other night fear and whiskey kept me going while the heroic tune from the
 violin keeps him upright
 
 but lets move past the drinking and look at what it stands for failure and
 camaraderie the mekons were born in 77 but were all but defunct by the mid80s
 they reunited to play benefit shows for miners during the strike of 8485 as
 nonaligned lefties the band raged against the thatcher administration and
 watched the suffering of miners who were on strike for a year and then went back
 to work in defeat but against that backdrop fear and whiskey doesnt so
 much as stumble every disaster turns into a victory anthem from greenhalgh and
 langford shouting through hard to be human again to abernant 198485 which
 is a glorious waltz no matter how bleak the lyrics they seek to destroy us how
 much more is there left to lose
 
 the music is a mess of influences united on the bones of punk music the mekons
 always subscribed to the anything goes rules of britains class of 77 and
 fear and whiskey is their most famous example this was the record where
 they started to assimilate country music it was a radical move in mid80s britain
 not least because of the rightwing politics that were associated with the style
 musicologists have labelled this the father of altcountry that bastard offspring
 of indie rock and countrywestern though for as much as you hear it on darkness
 and doubt complete with a john wayne reference or the cover of hank williams
 hit lost highway country is just one of the styles jammed in here along with
 english folk leeds punk and whatever else was at hand anyone who expects
 scenic americana will stop short at the second song trouble down south a weird
 minidrama that would bring a lesser album to its knees ken lite narrates some
 kind of a military advance over a reggaeinflected drum machine and a wheezing
 accordion while soprano jaqui callis struggles to hit her highest notes as far
 as it fits here at all its to force the listener to accept that the mekons are
 ready and willing to do whatever they want
 
 no matter how scattershot the first few songs sound the second half of the album
 justifies everything with a proper band assembled these last five songs were
 recorded and mixed one fine spring day in 1985 and they make up one of the most
 spontaneous exciting and perfect album sides ever for fourteen minutes from
 flitcraft to lost highway the mekons dont touch the ground this is music
 that is effortlessly spontaneously great with a massive beat that sweeps along
 grim lyrics like we know that for many years theres been no country here
 
 but its right near the end that they play the crowning song the most perfect
 part of the album last dance a pop song that sounds like it had never been
 played before that day but where every note falls in place down to that throwaway
 guitar solo and honeymans beautiful fiddle so bright it could make you want to
 cry the narrator sings about the end of the night when the musics winding down
 and its time to search the room for someone to take home the lyrics are resigned
 to failure but then there are two lines in the middle so beautiful you were
 waltzing little frozen rivers all covered in snow sung by a man whose desire
 stretches his capacity for eloquence he could have just seen the woman hell marry
 and he probably goes home alone
 
 the mekons didnt stand on the brink of collapse because they chose to they
 accepted the knowledge that everything could be ripped from their hands the
 thatcher administration could declare war on the people the miners could lose
 the strike you could get one great night out of hundreds of bad ones and for
 those fleeting moments you grab whatever you can even if its just a handful of
 rowdy old songswhen i received slackjaws darkest hour my first reaction was to groan and
 construct a lengthy laundry list of superficial complaints the band name ugh
 the typeface awful the cover art goofy maudlin photography the photos of
 androgynous pinkhaired teenagers in the liner notes make it stop the song
 titles for the love of god your beauty the sunrise and the profound
 sense of foreboding the preceding qualities ensured
 
 superficial issues aside
 
 slackjaws darkest hour may be the best example of a 50 record ive ever
 heard its physical attributes are more or less average nine songs in 46 minutes
 most of which average around the fiveminute mark excepting one short song and
 one long song the sound falls squarely between nouveau emo and radioheadinspired
 album rock the musicians are competent the songwriting is occasionally inspired
 and occasionally abysmal but largely pleasant pedestrian and innocuous the
 lyrics mostly rhyme contain a requisite amount of postmodern malaise and sometimes
 employ pretty poetic affectation most of the songs seem to be about failing
 relationships and the sort of existential angst associated with mornings after and
 drinking alone
 
 and you could say well you could say the same thing about a lot of bands
 almost every band in fact which would prove my point that right
 there is the heart of the 50 average and theres nothing inherently wrong
 with average its a glass halffull or halfempty scenario
 
 for the case of halffull the first thing to go the albums opener is lush
 and cinematic building on a pleasant sort of whitenoised soundscape singer eric
 schopmeyers hushed vocal technique provides a nice complement to the music itself
 it evokes the right sort of pretty yet sad tone that dominates the rest of the
 album for a threesome slackjaw has a relatively full sound assisted in part by
 a wide variety of instrumentation and ill give them this its hard to integrate
 chimes without sounding ridiculous they pull it off well
 
 another bonus songs flow almost seamlessly into one another this works particularly
 well with the first two tracks the first thing to go and unscathed the latter
 switching gears so dramatically halfway through that i thought theyd fucked up
 the tracklist actually the jury is still out on whether this is clever or just
 irritating the instrumentation makes a huge difference too on white noise
 jazz piano plays counterpoint to dissonant bursts of guitar its a cunning trick
 of composition which represents what these guys do exceptionally well suffice to
 say these guys have a lot of potential
 
 on the halfempty tip certain moments on darkest hour most notably the
 overblown one too many mornings are indeed atmospheric but in that
 breakupsceneinateenmovie sort of way they sound very typical and can bear
 a marked resemblance to the emotive rock hits featured on the commercial
 alternative stations those ones by the bands whose names you never remember
 which is aided by singer eric schopmeyers theatrical vocal style his tenor
 moans recall collegerock crooners and secondrate jeff buckley impersonators
 and the breathy whispered filler is distractingly artificial this combination
 evokes the inevitable worldweary tone favored by four out of five sensitive
 teenagers with blackframed glasses it would be something special if it hadnt
 been done before but it has and it isnt
 
 significant orchestral arrangements can occasionally bolster an otherwise
 simplistic sound but im not entirely sure slackjaw is ready for a grand opus
 the inclusion of unusual instrumentation can also smack of selfimportance and
 middling songwriter skills part of me that wishes someone hadnt complied with
 the probable studio command to make it bigger there are very few artists in
 the world that can pull off fulltilt album rock pretension for all i know
 slackjaw may arise as saviors of rock and roll after all stranger things
 have happened but darkest hour isnt going to get them there
 
 and one further note wearing your influences on your sleeve only works if you
 deviate from the formula with the possible exception of white noise every
 song on here sounds like a tribute to another band from radiohead on the first
 thing to go to american analog set on all that remains dead ringer that
 slackjaw perform with some agility is of secondary concern because ultimately
 its sort of boringi know what you expect from this review and you should be ashamed of yourself
 none of you readers are actually sitting there thinking hmm i wonder if that
 new bad religion album is worth buying ill see what pitchfork says about it
 of course not youre all like a bunch of sharks circling around a freshly thrown
 bucket of chum you want to see blood you want to see gore you want to see
 your friendly neighborhood elitist thoroughly skewering a band long past its prime
 
 well tough im not gonna give it you and i do this not out of any moral or
 ethical standard but rather because i am a writer of fine literature disguised as
 humble little record reviews and resorting to such a predictable course is beneath
 me
 
 sure the process of belief serves up enough slopitch softballs for me to
 spend a thousand words hitting wiseacre home runs this is after all a band of
 fortysomethings playing music more appropriate to kids struggling with puberty and
 algebra its an album where the first entity thanked in the liner notes is all
 punks everywhere its an album with a song called kyoto now which actually
 honest to god contains a turning japanese orientalstyle riff and the lyric
 you might not think theres any wisdom in a fucked up punk rock song
 
 but you know i find it strangely reassuring that bad religion sounds exactly the
 same as when i last heard them sometime around 1994s stranger than fiction
 now this could be because the process of belief marks the return of
 guitarist mr brett gurewitz from behind his executives desk at epitaph but i
 kinda dont think so like death and taxes one thing you can count on in this
 world is that most bad religion songs are going to use a combination of rapidfire
 power chords snare and bassheavy drums 25word machine gun vocals and
 those creepy syntheticsounding harmonies
 
 honestly if you can turn off your frontal lobe and forget that youve heard songs
 like this forty or fifty times before from bad religion theres a few piping hot
 tracks to be found in the process of belief on occasion gurewitz and
 singer greg graffin continue to show strong hookwriting ability as with the
 frontloaded oldschool drag racers supersonic and cant stop it and if
 you slowed down evangeline to halfspeed the result would be the best weezer
 song of the last six years
 
 furthermore nothing makes a case for bad religion sticking to their thematic guns
 like the sporadic and rather hilarious attempts to stretch their sound the
 reggaepunk of sorrow for example hasnt been considered adventurous since
 around the time of my birth late in the carter administration obvious pleas for
 radio play like the midtempo and acousticflavored broken make you feel a
 little sorry for the band and their memories of brief midnineties altrock
 stardom sing it you and meee have a diseaease
 
 most of the album however is indistinguishable from anything postno control
 and sounds like it couldve been released any time in the last twelve years of the
 bands history the question would be then is the bad religion formula still
 relevant im going to take a shocking stance here and say yup hear me out
 
 back when i was concerned about such things i used to have a theory that punk
 rock split at some undetermined point into two camps goofy punk about girls
 and food ie the descendents and political punk about socialism and governmental
 corruption ie bad religion over the past few years its become apparent
 that the goofy punks won with the green dayblink182sum 41 lineage remaining
 the only commercially viable branch on the punk rock family tree political punk
 as far as i know has all but disappeared is propagandhi still around leaving
 only its great grandpappy to carry the torch for educating our nations youth
 about petrochemical conspiracies
 
 therefore i think discovering bad religion and their chomsky for dummies rhetoric
 is an important experience for a youth in hisher formative musical years sure
 their politics are a little flimsy and idealistic the line when all soldiers lay
 their weapons down would make even a 1967 haightashbury drum circle queasy but
 graffins lyrics at least can plant questions in a seventh graders brain more
 profound than whether that girl in study hall likes him and its all delivered
 in the kind of sugarhigh sonic package that speaks most directly to the age range
 in question
 
 so buy a copy of the process of belief for your little brother or niece
 or boy scout troop chances are theyll probably enjoy it a lot more than fennesz
 and youll be setting them on a path towards heightened musical and political
 awareness bad religion i salute youwhen one thinks of the early days of electronic music one often imagines some
 crazy old professor locked up in a lab communicating with a machine the size of
 a house churning out something illogical and strange which no one but the most
 diehard of avantgardists would ever hear but this was not always the case take
 raymond scott for example a maverick mind who made music with computers in the
 1950s60s whether or not you know his name youve heard his music his short
 compositions served as the score for everything from twinkies commercials to
 marvin the martian cartoons such was the fate of most early electronic artists
 though their names may never be known by anyone but the most obsessive music
 nerds their work will live on both in its random appearances in popular culture
 and in the effect it had on artists of today
 throughout the 1960s and 1970s scott and others like him toiled away in relative
 obscurity making short pieces the rights to which would often later be purchased
 by television producers recent years have seen enterprising record labels filing
 through the vaults of this socalled library music recent compilations like motel
 records cinemaphonic soul punch series strut uks music for dancefloors
 the cream of the chapell music library sessions and manhattan research
 basta records compilation of recently unearthed recordings by scott showcased
 an amazing array of music all farahead of its time and most of it steeped in
 anonymity half the fun of this music of course lies with that air of familiarity
 even if youve never heard the particular song before it has a feel thats similar
 to the music youve been hearing all your life without ever knowing it
nuggets luke viberts selection is lo recordings stab at the library
 music compilation market comprised largely from works by french musicians nino
 nardini roger roger and eddie warner who are also billed as peter bonello
 cecil leuter and georges teperino respectively nuggets is a collection
 of short psychedelic tunes pulling equally from the realms of funk rock and jazz
 with heavy doses of synths and delays and to help you justify dropping your
 wellearned dollars the fine folks at lo even included viberts name on the
 package
 but its actually more than a marketing ploy viberts actually a pretty logical
 choice as curator this is the sort of stuff hes been sampling in his work for
 years apparently juicy luke himself spent a few weeks digging through a series
 of archives to compile this disc most of which has never seen release to the
 general public much like viberts recordings as wagon christ the music on
 nuggets tends to walk that fine line between funkydanceable and
 toogoofyforitsowngood and also like his music there are moments which
 suffer from mediocrity but those moments where everything meshes are strong
 enough to make up for it
 luckily these tracks are short and wellsequenced enough to make up for any dull
 moments look at the way epstein and kramans utterly silly turkish delight
 which consists of a escalating keyboard pattern scatting vocals manipulated to
 sound like a child and complimentary synth horns and vibes comes after the
 straightforward funk of richard demarias next episode which seems pulled right
 out of a coldcut solid steel mix
 or the way georges teperinos forward moving 70sactionshowthemesongesque
 cleopatra follows the lazy day introspection of nardinis 33second soft bossa
 which with softly strummed guitars warm strings and a lush female vocal sounds
 exactly like its name implies and the repetitive synthlines and drum machine that
 make up boneschi electronic combos somewhat boring the bungler
 or the way short tracks like bonellos electronic track 10 david hollands
 zouche drums 3 both of which were made with percussion only and nardinis
 cheesy bumbling along break up longer numbers like the johanna groups excellent
 strange love action a song thats equal parts acoustic guitar noodling
 pseudomusique concrtestyle electronic sounds avantgarde strings and 70s
 rock clich medley or jack arelpierre dutours sundown which contrasts the
 sparseness of strings and handdrums with the fullness of synthgenerated horn
 piano and drum fanfares
 the best tracks here meld the experimental electronics with decidedly accessible
 pop music making the new and foreign approachable eddie warners telex
 incorporates the beeping of a telegram with a slowbutpleasant pop structure
 built around a simple drum machine pattern roger rogers frantique begins and
 ends with a deep but simple keyboard melody that trades parts with heavily
 distorted cymbals but somewhere in the middle a frantic eh eh guitar part
 breaks in followed by ambient electronic noodling that circles around the
 effected cymbals for a minute or so before bringing us back to earth
 other tracks try the same trick with less success pots and pans by a kingj
 matthews seems like a musique concrte piece thrown on top of a funk song with
 no thought given to where the two parts match call it an exercise in cageian
 chance music if you wish me i call it clunky and difficult
 still most of these tracks are worthwhile if at times a bit silly but its a
 safe bet that anyone drawn to this disc by viberts name wont mind a little
 kookiness just as its a safe bet youve never heard any of these tracks before
 even if at times it sounds like you havenothing downtoearth is an accurate description of charlesmile beullacs
 maiden voyage under the galerie stratique guise beullac describes his work as
 mistyabstract electronica which sets up loathsome images of an airbrushed future
 as envisioned by the preraphaelite brotherhood but no matter what brickbats beullac
 throws you should head straight for the album its the most refreshing pureidm
 album ive heard since ulrich schnauss far away trains passing by was
 released late last year nothing downtoearth is so complete an album
 that i cant possibly condone law and auder even thinking about commissioning a
 remix record
 beullac distinguishes himself by being concise and true to himself hes
 selfassured enough not to leap on any bandwagon or to pay more than passing lip
 service to current software and styles nothing downtoearth is therefore
 starkly bereft of postautechre laptop crunch and schematic glitch beullacs beats
 are not entities removed from the drifting spaciness of his ambience hes
 integrated them into the texture of his pieces and thereby released them from
 just signifying rhythmic units this approach to beatprogramming reminds me of
 the time of autechres tri repetae nothing downtoearth additionally
 derives its ambivalent complexsimple style from global communications 7614
 and reloads a collection of short stories as a result anyone expecting
 beullac to be a bleedingedge member of the montreal electronic scene will find
 this album wistfully nostalgic by the same token if youre up for some almost
 forgotten artificial intelligence and headphone listening nothing downtoearth
 delivers in spades
 with the opener star filter beullac begins as he means to go on the song is
 a delicately echoed drift through dust motes algeria follows mutating the
 first tracks theme with a middleeastern inflected variant as the track builds
 tension repeating the melody line and adding incrementally more oppressive
 percussion beullac releases a powerful analog bass drone to maintain order
 still an alien countermelody soon appears and challenges all other elements for
 dominance
 leviathan is the first piece that borrows from the processed burundistyle
 drumming that jon hassell and brian eno used for their seminal and visionary
 possible music beullac gives his polyrhythms prominence and uses dark
 ambient tones to infuse leviathan with a looming monstrous quality that
 justifies its title frozen lakes reprises the echoing chimes of star filter
 but as its three times as long beullac has the opportunity to add a nomadic
 melodica line i find frozen lakes an inappropriate title because the music is
 far more fluid than id expect from a piece with this name its the melodica
 line that connotes for me distance and yearning and within the context of this
 piece my third eye imagines wandering through the heatless vastness of space or
 perhaps ive been listening to too many augustus pablo records to appreciate any
 other situation for a melodica
 inevitably nothing downtoearth cannot escape the influence of the boards
 of canada though rylka borrows its nave melody from music has the right to
 children beullac distinguishes the track by adding some burundibywayofpossible
 music percussion luna begins as a reworking of albinonis adagio for orb
 devotees but beullac breaks out his melodica for another mournful trip across the
 universe
 opale is bassheavy master class in getting away with gauzy
 pitchslipping hooks just as the fuzzedout cathedral organ of soleil levant
 demonstrates what the phantom of the opera would play if hed been studying brian
 wilson and aphex twin the phantasmagoric and elegant four minutes of soleil
 levante are what simian spent their entire debut album trying to create the
 sound picture that beullac paints here is not the trite image of sun rising that
 the beatles did with here comes the sun beullacs sun is unmistakably more
 gnostic more order of the golden dawn than george harrisons happygolucky
 vision perpetuating beullacs shrouded disquieting style dictaphone is a
 namlooklike sequencer piece disrupted by static bursts and garbled speech
 again my third eye is overstimulated beullacs dictaphone is like the
 fortiesfuturist office supplies in alex proyas dark city
nothing downtoearth is as complete a debut as ive heard in ages unless
 youre looking for innovation theres nothing here that wont amaze you yes
 youve heard some of these textures before and yes beullac borrows from
 predecessors but i never lost beullac in this album his uniqueness is the
 background radiation of the universe of nothing downtoearth too many
 debuts submerge individuality in order to emulate and therefore become part of
 canonical idm releases though beullacs debut may not receive the plaudits it
 manifestly deserves because of its unwillingness to pay homage to reaktors latest
 upgrade or the mandates of the style council of the idm listserv i am over the
 moon with itdarla records james agren had to put down his vegan tofu wrap just to make sure
 hed read the email right barcelona were breaking up what a bummer not only
 were they one of the main bands on the pulcec imprint theyd basically written
 darlas website nobody else had a sound quite like theirs some people had
 taken to calling it programmer pop what with the keyboard melodies and all the
 references to computers and software and stuff of course they had taken to
 writing some stock songs like teenage pop star lately the keyboard intro
 soared like any classic new wave cut and the boygirl harmony was cute but what
 was with the chorus gonna be a teenage onehit washedup messedup megalomaniac
 yet the song sounded like it could be a saturday morning cartoon intro anyway
 they would be missed
 jeff couldnt believe the news about barcelona he didnt like much synthpop but
 the jangling guitars gave these guys a rocking sound they didnt use a drum
 machine either it was all live who else was going to write songs like i
 have the password to your shell account when he saw that song title on napster
 back in the day he thought it was a joke and jennifer carr whoa brains
 beauty and a good voice she could take his server down any day it
 didnt make any sense the new album was just as good as all the others west
 coast radio was like a beach boys song for the digital age with jason korzen
 singing about some intimidating california girl and carr cooing backing vocals
 the album art was cool too images of robots with serving trays photoshopped
 into pictures of african natives it was something conceptual about primitives
 and futurists but he had to get back to work the figures for the next round of
 missile tests needed to be in by five
 trevor kampmann had seen it coming all his engineering work couldnt do much
 for a song like the power of jen the surf riff wasnt much different than the
 cults she sells sanctuary and jen carr insisted on singing something twee
 about boys who kept calling her the chorus was total fluff jennifer
 ugh theyd written some really great songs for the album though human
 simulation bleeped along with its buzzy casio keyboards and carrs soaring
 id give you anything that you want was irresistible they really should have
 put her in front of the mic more often most of the songs featured korzen on
 main vocals and his delivery was just too forced cameron crowe was a fan and
 hed helped them to decide the final sequencing but they couldnt seem to put
 together enough songs to last half an hour they may have perfected their style
 but all the midtempo rhythms didnt make for much excitement and the guitar
 tone tended to slip into monotony
 sarah sat back from her imac shed just imagined a twosong suite it began
 with a minuteandahalflong instrumental april 1978 which featured a gently
 rolling beat and a guitar pinging at the high registers sentimentally that would
 serve as an introduction to i get the message another slow ballad that didnt
 descend into clich some lyrics even popped up in her head radio waves reflect
 across the screen terminal haze your transmissions beamed i feel the impact
 from the satellite thats calling me later on maybe shed have somebody going
 bahdah dahdah over and over again like a verbal expression of those lonely
 radio waves but then it occurred to her that maybe she was spending way too much
 time at rockstargamecom it was fun to watch her little automatons write the
 same songs over and over and everything makes me think about sex almost made
 it to hit single but it was clear that a indie rock band inspired by silly 80s
 groups like sparks probably didnt have a chance to climb to the top and it
 wasnt going to get her an a in logic time to get back to work
barcelona played its last show in february 2002well heres a blast from my past kind of anyway if youd just thrown this
 disc on and asked me where and when it was played i would have guessed manchester
 england 1992 without giving it much thought and i probably would have wondered
 how such a good little shoegazer record had managed to elude me as i swept the
 genre clean several years ago you see big swirly noisy british rock was the
 music that finally broke my closeminded assumption that no one had made any good
 music after the 70s and once i found it i dove in deep scooping up all the
 ride albums i could find and hunting down all of the elusive boo radleys records
 and eps i could find if asked i could produce a pretty massive stack of discs
 that fit at least vaguely in the category from acknowledged classics like
 loveless to obscurities like a 14 iced bears compilation
 
 of course ides of spaces debut album wasnt recorded in 1992 nor in manchester
 england rather its just an anachronism from sydney australia and damned if
 i dont love it i suppose its my lot to like an album like this given the
 special place this kind of music has in my heart but while i love it i have to
 face facts there are no new clouds breaks no new ground whatsoever and
 the ground it does tread is already beaten halfway to death
 
 this side of the screen opens the album with clean guitars and crisp drums that
 could have come straight off of rides nowhere patrick haid intones in a
 heavily accented tenor and gets through most of a verse before the inevitable wall
 of distortion blasts in from both speakers and wraps everything in a dense fuzz
 arthurs car follows with a much brisker rhythm and mostly clean guitars opting
 instead to allow martin barkers keyboards to fill in the spaces that would
 normally be occupied by noise haids voice is doubled over the top delivering
 a strong melody in a tone reminiscent of some of american indiedoms tweer elements
 like witch hazel and spectacle
 
 from there the band blasts through eight other blissedout nuggets most of which
 would have been worthy of an nme single of the week column about a decade
 ago at this point though theyre simply enjoyable and i think the quality of
 the music says something for the band the way they play and write its hard to
 believe theyve only been together for two years the melodies are well developed
 and the playing is technically flawless yet rough enough to sound real the only
 consistently unpredictable timbre is barkers keyboard but the ides vary the feels
 and tempos enough that the songs dont blur together
 
 random noise generator ably displays the bands tightness and skill with its
 switch from a quiet slow spacy intro into a quickpaced rocker with an impressive
 instrumental breakdown in the middle the band builds toward a climax but instead
 stops short with a brief silence before blasting back into the verse the device
 is a little less effective when repeated for the outro but they vary the approach
 slightly by filling the silence with a delaydrenched keyboard and cropping the
 buildup
 
 guitarist mark ayoub serves up some appealing if highly derivative lead parts to
 counterbalance haids airy lead vocal on i promise not to notice if you promise
 to pretend the rhythm section of brothers anthony and david the hits particularly
 hard on this song too laying down a solid driving foundation for the other
 members more skyward aspirations
 
 its followed by computer world which though unfortunately not a surprise
 kraftwerk cover offers a good look at the bands facility with slower quieter
 songs beginning with sparse guitar strumming and a distant keyboard drone that
 wouldnt sound terribly out of place on an old talk talk or recent hood record
 it evolves into a windswept ballad that makes good use of space between instruments
 and notes only opting to fill it with loud distortion near the very end
 
 part of what makes this album so successful is the guiding hand of producer wayne
 connolly who sees to it that no matter how loud or noisy it is no one part
 overwhelms any of the others in a way that it shouldnt in addition to being
 well and confidently played this album even sounds good this record isnt
 really for everybody though if youre not already a convert to the shoegazer
 aesthetic this wont be the disc that changes your mind but despite the fact
 that it doesnt really do anything that original theres plenty of good stuff to
 be found here and there are no new clouds while an unintentionally
 accurate title at the very least reveals a young band with scads of potential
 if they came this far in two years imagine where theyll be after two moresunn o an incidental history
 
 1955 louie louie is penned and originally performed by richard berry songwriter
 and frontman for rb outfit richard berry and the dreamers
 
 1963 louie louie as interpreted by portland oregon garageband the kingsmen
 causes a sensation due in no small part to the unintelligible lyrical rendition
 by lead singer jack ely while on the road bassist norm sundholm appalled by
 the lack of volume available from his bass cabinet contacts brother conrad
 sundholm to help him with a solution
 
 1964 while the state of indiana bans the kingsmens hit louie louie from the
 radio citing suspected obscenities in the aforementioned unintelligible
 lyrical rendition a case which fbi head j edgar hoover himself would take up
 and not drop until 1965 conrad sundholm creates the worlds first highpowered
 concert bass amplifier
 
 1965 an increased interest in the amplifiers leads to increased orders from
 guitarists and bassists alike prompting conrad to move the operation out of his
 fathers garage the sunn amplifier company is born
 
 1969 sunn amplifiers are used for the famed monstrous sound system at the
 woodstock music and arts fair in upstate new york
 
 the sunno mission is to create trance like soundscapes with the ultimate low
 endbottom frequencies intended to massage the listeners intestines into an act
 of defecation
 
 before forming this band in honor of earth the powerful dronedoom outfit who
 somehow released four albums on sub pop while maintaining a higher doomdrone
 ration than any other band from the northwest steve omalley and greg anderson
 did time in burning witch and goatsnake respectively but sunno is a
 different beast entirely a dual homage to the two things that count bravado
 and volume
flight of the behemoth is fifty minutes of wellcalculated doomdrone that
 in one swift take manages to sound slower than sleep more hypnotic than sabbath
 and ten times more powerful than any early 60s nyc drone music john cale tony
 conrad etc and for one simple reason its based on metal
 
 the opening track death becomes you does not fade in it kicks the fucking
 door open and does not stop riffing every so slightly until the end of its
 thirteen minutes when it crackles out with the sound of a chorus of crackling
 speakerkilling malfunctions mocking solemnity follows employing similar
 tactics save for some extra feedback and a bit more highend
 
 sunnobow 1 and sunnobow 2 are extremely wellfortified remixes of
 sunn o tracks by masami akita who you might know better by his alias merzbow
 merzbow steps in on top of these tracks and his match met the by lowend
 sludgemasters present in the mix decides to liven the tracks up with some
 plunking piano in the left channel accompanied by signature highend noise
 bursts in the right the second remix ends in a terrifying swirl of noise and
 bass which comes pretty close to the sunno mission referenced above needless
 to say the addition of merzbow to these tracks is very welcome
 
 the final track entitled fwtbt i dream of lars ulrich being thrown the bus
 window instead of my master mystikall kliff burton starts out with what
 sounds like a detuned 808 kickdrum hit before it melts savagely into a furious
 and panting repetition of the previous tracks nicely executed mo add some
 faint drumming and some overtly breathy singing and you have what sounds like
 a sabbath song with all the tricks focused in one place stretched out over ten
 minutes without the imagery necessary to propel you straight downward
 
 when i first heard sleeps jerusalem i thought that the ultimate in slowness
 and deliberation had been reached that it would not be possible to transcend the
 completely stoned realm of nazareth that the hourlong concept album champions
 obviously i wasnt looking hard enough
 
 this album sounds like it could have been recorded ten miles away from woodstock
 while it was happening with special microphones buried ten miles below the surface
 of the earth to only catch the vibrations of the bass on stage and the pounding of
 all those hippies doing whatever the hell it was they were doing the trajectory
 that begins with richard berry and ends with merzbow leaves me wondering what j
 edgar hoover would have thought of this album and then i remember that he was a
 crossdressertheres some kind of magic in australias dirty three its now wellestablished
 that the records they make together are great but just as interesting is how much
 they bring to projects outside the band each members instrumental style is both
 unique and extremely portable jim white and mick turner work together beautifully
 as a freelance rhythm section on records with the likes of cat power and will
 oldham and on the evidence of the one seveninch i have they also shine when
 they collaborate as the tren brothers kits choice is incredibly affecting
 meanwhile violinist warren ellis has kept busy working on film scoring projects
 along with playing with nick cave among others the 3 pieces for violin ep
 is his first solo record as well as one of the first releases on mick turners
 king crab label and keeping with the trend its superb
 
 actually the genesis of these pieces was also collaboration this time with
 canadian dance company holy body tattoo these three short tracks were originally
 a sonic backdrop to a piece called circa but dont worry you dont need
 to be staring at stonefaced automatons in lyrca body stockings to enjoy the music
 all serve as a fine showcase for ellis highly physical violin style which moves
 easily between earthy folk and contemporary classical textures
 
 the latter is display on the first piece in which a jarring fiercely sawed
 opening with sharp edges of dissonance develops into an eerie slithering melody
 with several overdubbed violins as heard on whatever you love you ares
 i offered it up to the stars and the night sky ellis has a real knack for
 layering his violin parts imparting a chamber music feel without forgoing his
 aggressive tone
 
 the second track finds ellis heading in the direction of drone music as one fiddle
 bows furiously on a single string giving a rumbling undercurrent not unlike some
 of cales viola work with the velvet underground he uses another track to spread
 an ethereal almost celtic melody on top track three is more relaxed and
 contemplative starting with a plucked chord and then adding the kind of yearning
 poignant lead line that stradivarius designed the instrument for his thick tone
 is certainly one of ellis calling cards but his brilliant melodic sense is what
 makes his music so memorable in and out of his main band even though 3 pieces
 for violin adds up to only 16 minutes of music its close to an essential
 purchase for dirty three fansimagine if shoegazer became the standard in popular music like jazz did in the
 1940s some equivalent of ken burns would at some point make a 10hour epic
 chronicling the rise of slowdive ride chapterhouse and most notably my bloody
 valentine and the shoegazing equivalent of dave brubeck would counter the attacks
 of purists with pronouncements like any idiot can swirl
 
 somewhere in this imagined universe the emerald down is firmly stuck in 1991
 playing shoegazer standards every thursday night at a holiday inn lounge outside
 columbus maybe staring catatonically at their enormous pink shag carpetcovered
 amplifiers while a small crowd of greyfaced business travelers work just intently
 on their whiskey sours at the bar
 
 it would take this kind of stylistic dominance and the kind of subsubgenre
 stratification that would inevitably follow from critics to tell apart and keep
 straight the hoards of faceless shoegazer bands that to this day keep cropping
 up inexplicably im sure hardcore devotees of this style of music can recognize
 the subtle nuances separating all these bands that seem completely interchangeable
 to those of us who just dabble in what we consider the cream of the crop but the
 debut from the emerald down scream the sound is so unabashedly retro that
 it just strikes me as sad theyve obviously invested a lot of time and energy
 into getting their imitation just right
 
 the question is why why make an album that not only has already been made and
 not only been made better but has been made better about 300 times over at last
 count i guess every genre has room for the b and cleague acts and there are
 certainly people out there who would eat this up but theres really no need for
 this unless you already own the entire output of the above mentioned bands plus
 about a dozen other groups still there is something sickly endearing about a
 band so stuck in its own world that it refuses to acknowledge anything much has
 happened musically since the early 90s
 
 all the classic shoegazer touchstones are present on scream the sound
 dense layered production aesthetic loads of guitars everything buried in a
 primordial soup of sound and an average song length of six minutes plus the
 boygirl vocals offer a nice touch though that too has been done about a million
 times by shoegazer bands and besides everything is covered in such a sonic
 glaze that all vocals are pretty much indistinguishable from one another
 
 their idea of switching gears like most bands of their ilk is to flirt with
 shoegazers daintier cousin dreampop but this doesnt offer much in the way of
 variation and even after three or four times through the album nothing really
 stands out if i had to pick one track though it would be recondite astral
 traveler if only for the title alone but it also has slightly more sinister
 almost psychedelic feel to it a close second would be perilized which
 strangely reminds me of soft cells sex dwarf
 
 but in the end the album simply stands as yet another testament to how influential
 my bloody valentine wasis too much so it seems so dominant and pervasive is
 their sound that it has stifled much if any stylistic growth within the shoegazer
 genre at least on anything above a microcosmic level ten years after loveless
 bands the world over this particular one is from columbus via portland are still
 eager to faithfully reenact the intoxicatingly dense swirl and shimmering feedback
 of kevin sheilds co showing little desire to push it forward and the emerald
 down like so many others seem more than willing to be lost in sonic maelstromperhaps im missing something the sixth lp from lambchop everyones favorite
 nashvillebased quatuordectet fourteen members look it up has been released
 to generally positive murmuring from the bespectacled intellirock crowd to me
 this indicates that kurt wagner and his nashville friends have joined that
 exclusive herd of sacred musical cows alongside their pals in yo la tengo
 in the eyes of critics the world over they seem to have been deemed untouchable
 
 which is why i feel like im going to have my music critics union local 462
 card revoked when i say is a woman is a disappointment but before you
 lay down your harsh punishment oh wise union magistrates allow me to present
 the evidence for the albums underwhelming effect upon your humble supplicant
 
 i generally like lambchop quite a bit their last two albums of new stuff 2000s
 nixon and 1998s what another man spills collected genres like
 baseball cards and created an easy listening sound that soothed the soul without
 triggering the gag reflex as the bands makeshift orchestra performed horn and
 string swoops worthy of a vegasstyle lounge revue wagners lyrics and offkilter
 vocals provided just enough of a wink to indicate we were all in on the joke and
 that it was okay to enjoy the music of our grandmothers hey remember irony
 
 but from the vince guaraldilike instrumental intro of is a womens opening
 track the daily growl its apparent that the keyword for this outing is
 sparse fourteen people twenty if you count guests have never sounded so
 quiet throughout the album lambchop sounds less like the orchestra from name
 that tune and more like a piano jazz group whose drummer took the night off
 gone for the most part is the genrehopping the falsetto the lushness and
 the cornet dear god why the cornet
 
 dangerously the new sound would indicate that wagner is taking himself a whole
 lot more seriously this time around to less entertaining effect while his
 lyrics still have the ability to provoke many a doubletake by the second song
 hes already namedropped chicken of the sea intel and sherwinwilliams the
 delivery is considerably more straightforward less fauxcrooner than actual
 crooner wagners aspirations to being the dean martin or bing crosby of indie
 rock have never been more obvious and its further made clear by the disturbingly
 high prominence of his voice in the mix think mark kozelek on old ramon or
 bridge
 
 the rest of the band meanwhile is largely relegated to the background or the
 occasional flourish with the exception of tony crows frequently frontandcenter
 piano admittedly the sparing use of lambchops formerly characteristic
 orchestral sound is often striking the honking baritone sax sprinkled into
 portions of the new cobweb summer the softly resonating vibes and quivering
 moog of caterpillar also nice is the variously filtered angelic chorus
 answering wagners nanas on i can hardly spell my name and the sudden drop
 into litereggae halfway through the albumclosing title track
 
 but the listener has to work through a great deal of less stimulating material
 before reaching these worthwhile moments with most of the eleven tracks running
 at least five minutes furthermore the almost complete absence of significant
 drumming or percussion until the albums eighth track stretches the prolonged
 lull of my blue wave and the old matchbook trick even longer with little
 rhythm to anchor songs of such epic length they much too easily float off into
 the atmosphere
 
 most tragic though is the startling uniformity of the album save the stopstart
 strut of d scott parsley lambchop has stripped away much of the country and
 soul influence that made previous work so hard to categorize whats left is a
 polished and subtle jazzbased sound thats hardly bad but hardly good for more
 than intense bedroom headphone sessions or wineandcheese parties
 
 a small asscovering caveat is a woman sounds threateningly like a grower
 album the kind that suddenly clicks on the 108th listen as genius on the par of
 pet sounds loveless or apparently that new trail of dead album
 if this is indeed the case im sure ill soon be run out of criticsville by a
 torchbearing mob this embarrassingly shortsighted review preserved for all
 eternity in the pitchfork archives until that day however i throw myself upon
 the mercy of the courtwhen a twoyear old flies into a fit of impotent helpless rage it can scream its
 head off it doesnt even need to say anything or explain itself it just lets
 fly most adults forget this surefire route to feeling better but not mike
 anderson as frontman for the indiana noisecore band racebannon anderson shrieks
 and gibbers almost unintelligibly crumpling the words like fast food wrappers in
 a muckclogged gutter the listener hears it just as sound but if you look up
 the lyrics in the liner notes theyre clear and succinct for example yr
 ability to head face first into the dirt has taught you nothing but how to get
 lost in this open field of market and value ive got heartburn i cant pay my
 goddamn rent hey i can relate to that can i scream too
 
 andersons vocal geekshow and the bands artsy leanings set racebannon apart from
 your average angry hardcore band theyre a rock quartet that can rip through
 fast high thrash but while the songs usually start loud and spastic most of
 them run long half are over eight minutes and the extended writing the
 interesting use of sounds and the effective cover of captain beefhearts
 electricity suggest theres an art band behind the violent facade like the
 vocals the guitars smear and spray as often as they make statements the rhythm
 section plays solid hardcore but it can also play freeform as with the scattered
 hihats on im yr egomaniac racebannon also throw in effects theremin and
 on egomaniac some kind of bells or chiming glass sound
 
 fortunately racebannon never loses intensity no matter how long or complicated
 the music becomes even the shorter songs like flip n fuck or fuck yr obvious
 words transition from screaming thrash to effectstricken outros but the opening
 sections are strong enough to keep the rest of the song from wandering on the
 other hand the best songs acquire an awesome magnitude as they ramble on
 clubber lang kicks off with a great guitar riff and digs solidly into position
 behind andersons rant as it jerks through the noises and gizmos of the ending
 anderson trails off into the distance the most interesting song on the album
 the closer im yr egomaniac builds dramatically with slow drones and the
 hihats and bell sounds mentioned above while anderson spits out an entire
 monologue
 
 racebannon wont win over everybody as the label avantnoisecore suggests
 they tend to push themselves into a niche strict hardcore fans might balk at
 the long songs and instrumental sections while people who dont dig hardcore at
 all will have trouble with the lack of melodies hooks or approachable beats
 the recording is immaculate and surprisingly unabrasive but it could stand to
 get messier its also a little shy on the lowend you get the impression
 that the band is heavy but not very heavy angry but not aggressive no
 matter how ferocious and ugly it sounds the ugliness is happening to somebody
 else but on those terms its a compelling and original album theres a lot of
 appeal to kicking back and listening to these guys spill their troubles and
 frustrations you dont even need to catch all the wordsnothing brings me to crummy stripmalls swifter than crummy used cd marts i love
 their 1 bins i love the dusty stench that manages to conquer the reek of the
 friedchicken place next door and wards off all but the most determined diggers
 but more than anything i love these bins because ive discovered so many great
 records in them one such gem is circles andexelt before thursday
 afternoon i knew nothing of this finnish band but by the typography that reminded
 me of brothomstates claro and the mechanized bodypart photography that
 occupies the lowest sixth of the cover i knew i should punt my buck
 after a thirtyminute metro ride home and enough time to brew a pot of coffee i
 was ready to try out andexelt id lined up other discs just in case it
 in fact turned out to be scandinavian doom metal or a cunning front for an area
 smooth jazz combo i neednt have bothered andexelt is still in my cd
 tray days later the album is pure krautrock and it is the most invigorating
 collection ive heard since a french canadian called charlesmile sent me his
 debut album nothing down to earth
 circle i googled are a fivepiece who since 1991 have been astounding those just
 south of the arctic circle with their muscular explorations of space time and
 the pandimensional megariff andexelt is their seventh fulllength and
 you need to hear it often the record voyages to the same places as les maccanns
 layers but takes a different route grafting neus motorik percussion
 berlinera bowie synths to robbie shakespeares dubby basslines and riding a
 guitar wave that recalls black sabbath and michael karoli andexelt
 surpasses braintickets adventure and equals cans future days in
 loaded grace
 if this band were wellknown the chemical brothers would have already sampled
 janne peltomkis rhythmsalvo of the opening title track and music critics at
 large would already have acknowledged circles ferocity the bands guitarist
 teemu elo unloads a doublebarreled reverb riff straight in your face and while
 youre busy searching for bits of your head frontman jussi lehtisalos analog
 synth enters intent on slicing to ribbons any sounds that cross its path
 fortunately its hard labor cutting away at peltomkis resilient groove elo
 and lehtisalo form a clusterbombing alliance against him but the man relentlessly
 motoriks on
 for odultept the band jumps on the fender rhodes spacejazz and bolsters their
 move by allowing bassist j laiho to showcase his fitsandstarts dubbass abilities
 guest t huunonen gives up a galactic flute solo after an explosion of arp synths
 and the band decides to take a tour round the interstellar medium 20milate is
 an arkestral reworking of my bloody valentines you made me realize whereas
 lispui mines the same stooges treasury that julian copes brain donor project
 did except circle got there first and stole the heavenly guitar line that
 agitation frees liquidharmony guitarist lutz ulbrich had left behind humusaar
 emerges from a doomy bass ground into a receding fxspattered starfield and the
 brooding numinous closer kidulgos proves that circle have processed tangerine
 dreams nebulous zeit as well as the thirdeye mantra of electronic
 meditation
andexelt is astounding no two ways about it all its taken for me to get
 totally pumped up about this music has been a dollar yes it may be a little more
 than a 1010321 collect call but in that dusty bin i found something actually
 worth talking up to twenty minutes aboutsome music begs to be explored promising fascination and intrigue beyond your
 wildest dreams its distant melodies beckon you towards it while you try your very
 best to discern every distinct element that presents itself to you as you get
 closer and closer you begin to relax letting yourself become completely enveloped
 by the entrancing tones
 
 of course its all a trap just as you begin to lose yourself you become vaguely
 aware that the sound that soothingly beckoned you has now transformed into
 something vastly different something powerful dangerous and merciless what
 was so beautiful at a safe distance is still beautiful but what was once tranquil
 and peaceful has metamorphosed into a vicious violent glory before you can even
 respond youre flat on your back pulverized by its sheer force
 
 making music that is both delicate and dangerous requires a level of skill that
 most musicians can barely even fathom while some bands like the microphones
 succeed at capturing the simultaneous beauty and rage of nature what and you
 will know us by the trail of dead have encapsulated on their third fulllength
 source tags and codes is something distinctly human anger has always
 played a central role in the bands music but with this record theyve finally
 managed to capture all the subtle shades of disappointment melancholy frustration
 and hope that often accompany it
 
 of course capturing all this with music is no small feat source tags and
 codes is massive in its execution bursting with layered percussion deftly
 arranged strings and most importantly songs that are simply epic it was there
 that i saw you opens the album with squealing static and a clean guitar playing
 a simple tickling figure theres a palpable sense of excitement as the song
 suddenly explodes into a frenetic blast of crashing cymbals screeching guitars
 and thumping bass amidst the swell of sound conrad keelys voice takes on a
 sharp almost crystalline quality that cuts through the mix with biting force
 
 another morning stoner mimics it was there that i saw you in its opening moments
 but rather than exploding with pure energy it builds slowly and deliberately to an
 absolutely astonishing finale melodic guitar lines ricochet back and forth brought
 to new sonic elevations by soaring string arrangements the callandresponse
 section that finishes the song in which two members of the band exchange the
 phrases what is forgiveness its just a dream what is forgiveness its
 everything is one of many absolutely indelible moments on source tags and
 codes
 
 baudelaire follows the haunting another morning stoner with a blast of pure
 rock and roll catchy and incredibly sinister baudelaire builds upon a central
 immensely powerful guitar and trumpet riff with handclaps driving percussion and
 barely audible voices engaged in conversation eventually the song trails off
 into a single submerged guitar line accentuated by reverbsoaked bells
 
 just as the hypnotic ending to baudelaire pulls you into a trance homage
 picks you up by the hair smacks you around spits in your face and leaves you
 gasping for breath before imploding into a symphony of static how near how far
 and heart in the hand of the matter are the highlights of source tags and
 codes center utterly alive with energy and texture how near how far uses
 vocal harmonies and strings to reinforce a sense of violent melancholy and the
 unforgettable chorus to heart in the hand of the matter im so damned i cant
 win is enlivened by the contrast between gritty guitars and clear ringing piano
 
 after another expertly produced segue monsoon pulls together the rock swagger
 of baudelaire and the sentimentality of heart in the hand of the matter to
 wonderful effect the songwriting on source tags and codes is inconceivably
 elegant never predictable but never gratuitously dissonant parts of songs wind
 seamlessly into each other each one full of brilliant sonic nuances that are every
 bit as compelling when taken as part of the entire song as when examined individually
 fragmented feedback heralds the arrival of days of being wild a song that hosts
 some of the most creative instrumental interplay to grace this album before
 building to yet another utterly aweinspiring finale
source tags and codes is an album big on finales thus it makes sense that
 its three final tracks are quite possibly its best relative ways which was
 released earlier this year as a single is the most exquisitely constructed song
 here conrad keelys voice breaks and spits as he pleads its okay im a saint
 i forgave your mistakes an unexpected chord shift heightens the dramatic tension
 of the song just in time for it to return to its original theme and fade into
 after the laughter the only segue on source tags and codes to be given
 its own track a stunning concoction of dreamy vocal harmonies radio noises
 pianos and strings after the laughter is wonderful in its own right but taking
 into account the fact that the song perfectly bridges the melodies of relative
 ways and the albums closer source tags and codes it seems utterly brilliant
 
 as with any epic album source tags and codes demands an epic closer and
 the records title track delivers masterfully both a lyrical and melodic high
 point source tags and codes captures the complex emotions of the album in a
 brief glimpse of pure paradoxical beauty a perfect arrangement of the guitars
 piano strings bells and percussion that help make this record so intricate and
 powerful the song sounds almost like a bittersweet reunion with old friends a
 few seconds after last guitar has faded a string ensemble plays a brief gorgeous
 piece that is at once hopeful and somber the strings end in unison on a single
 note which is sustained for a few moments before fading out the impact is
 immediate you know without a moments doubt that you have just heard something
 that is absolutely classic
 
 and while source tags and codes does seem to carry with it a certain
 knowledge of its own brilliance it never tries to cheaply impress simply put
 it doesnt need to dense beautiful intricate haunting explosive and
 dangerous this is everything rock music aspires to be intense incredible songs
 arranged perfectly and performed with skill and passion source tags and
 codes will take you in rip you to shreds piece you together lick your
 wounds clean and send you back into the world with a concurrent sense of loss
 and hope and you will never ever be the samethey started out playing stuff that was fairly rough around the edges its not
 that the players were unfocused or nave but that they made a point not to do
 something which had already been done chiefly to turn out readymade product
 with the glossy veneer that had hooked the propop junkies only ten years their
 senior they played their boisterous clamor for a few years and moved on
 next up was a more sophisticated brand of noise though no less communicative for
 the change first they dropped the youthful bravado in favor of hip wisdom
 beyond their years its as if some weird muse had informed them that aiming for
 the intellect and modern mind could be cool and unprecedented for bands like
 them their friends followed their lead and before you knew it the arena that
 had once introduced them was now subject to their whims at the service of their
 transitions
 of course this didnt last long either pretty soon they were into all manner
 of trial media be it musical cultural or chemical and all of it managed to
 alter the music they played in fact some would argue that these people met a
 crossroads during this time as their public perception would forever be altered
 due not only to their newly acquired avantgarde curiosity but also to their
 completely comfortable way of passing through uncharted waters the only way out
 of this labyrinth was to step out of the game entirely which following suit and
 their likeminded brethren they did
 the next phase was to attempt to recapture some of the green enthusiasm of their
 first days albeit filtered through the inevitable change in their makeup from all
 the days of sophisticated odd evolution their music from this time was arguably
 the best they ever made in spite of the fact that the actual players were probably
 growing a bit tired of the journey with one another and that it would seem humans
 can only take so much change in so little a time but for better or for worse
 their friends went through the same things and the trend was to always be at the
 forefront of the trip so they persevered
 in fact the players were on the verge of implosion they had reached a point
 where change no longer seemed relevant and they decided to part ways rather than
 collectively grope for the next square and that was it
 this is the story of evolution and trends most people think of evolution beyond
 the religious implication of the term as an inevitable phenomenon like ice
 melting and then turning to gas vapor but when the concept of a trend comes up
 particularly in art its viewed as a negative thing theyre just following the
 trend or this will never last its just a trend well sure thats life
 right
 and then theres the above story i read it and thought the beatles of
 course it also applies to can led zeppelin the who even abba and if you
 take out the part about breaking up it seems oddly close to the story of u2
 rem boredoms and lets stop here all this allegory gets a little weighty
 after a bit
 with boredoms you can actually see the evolution and trend from album to album
 most bands are like this but within the scene from which boredoms are
 extrapolated you can see this stuff spread throughout rovo unjustly pegged
 as a boredoms side project when in fact they are more the project of nonbore
 violinist katsui yuji have been around since 1998 and have generally played a
 kind of heavytrance postrock like tortoise with energy replacing atmosphere
 funny though if you took the exact same band members and had them release a
 record in say 1991 it would almost certainly not sound like that
 back then yuji was just starting out with bondage fruit playing avantprog
 guitarist seiichi yamamoto was making serious racket with the early noisy
 boredoms drummer yoshigaki yasuhiro was playing freejazz and industrial noise
 with very early ground zero bassist jin harada was playing avant punkprog with
 bazooka joe it was a noisy time five years ago the same players would have
 been playing something a tad more sophisticated though always keeping an eye to
 improvisation and experimentation and today they play beatladen improvtrance
 they arent alone because in tokyo montreal and chicago and other places too
 this is the trend and if you think of trends and evolution as symbiotic
 occurrences then bands like rovo not only make sense they sound absolutely
 wonderful
sai is rovos fourth release though their only record to be released in
 america was 1999s imago for fans of the previous record the sound remains
 essentially the same with lengthy repetitive jams featuring intricate percussion
 courtesy of yasuhiro and okabe yoichis dual drum attack profuse electronic
 manipulation from nakanishi koji and coproducer masuko tatsuki all colored by
 nylon and other strings yuji yamamoto and harada this record isnt quite as
 influenced by idm as imago was and transfers much of the percussive drive
 to more straightforwardly rock rhythm tracks
 the album begins with a track in japanese whose title i believe translates as
 aurora borealis it begins with light waterbounce synth effects and gradually
 introduces the cymbals and hihat major players on this album rolling and
 swishing away this gives way to an actual beat though its closer to hard bop
 than gloomy postrock throughout yujis violin wails in the distance like a
 disembodied vocal or more likely an enoesque ambient cry but as underground
 japanese musicians are wont to do they play furiously where western postrockers
 would slide in unnoticed this is where the trend gives way to inherent
 indigenous qualities there seems to be something restless in the air there and
 despite all evidence of trance and hypnotic calm in the new style they still play
 like free spirits
 vida is the next track leading off with an expository hihat duet one drummer
 on the left side the other on the right theres a sinewave mediator to keep
 things colorful this slight diversion lasts better than three minutes all four
 of the tracks here are over ten minutes long before the band kicks in with a
 relatively straight if rapid krautrock groove drummers fighting in synch all
 the while again yujis violin colors the track paired with various synth
 noises and textures and yamamotos restrained strumming figures
 rano begins with a bouncy keyboard figure similar to the first track though
 this time accompanied by what sounds like a constant stream of water spraying at
 its fancy in the background there are few radar blips before the rest of the
 players come in with sais calmest tune an ostinato synth line with
 equal parts wahwah and analog pad resonance fires away and the song crescendos
 to a double time trancerock jam the best part of this album is that you could
 listen to it while tripping letting it serve as support system for various
 epiphanies or you could peer in to the detail and be treated to incredible
 musicianship and a more compact sound than seven people would be expected to
 make
 the last tune is seer which again features the hihat duet though here its
 ridiculously precise where the earlier one was exploratory drummers should
 get a kick out of this album if no one else though this stuff should work as
 well for laypeople and dont worry there is a little guitar to fluff it up a
 bit of course yamamoto seems to be playing with a velvet touch these days
 a far cry from his stoogescummelvins skronk of the early part of the last
 decade i wont fault him for calming down any more than i fault tortoise for
 not playing grunge first of all its not appropriate this isnt 1991 anymore
 and music people and trends change secondly it isnt fair why would i expect
 any musicians to exist in the narrow reality for which i have created for them
 thirdly its simply not smart rovo plays rovos music not boredoms not
 tortoises and no one elses whatever the evolution of their scene this is
 what theyre doing now and i think it sounds greati hear rex records is thinking about releasing an album of indie groups performing
 prince songs what would u do if u 2 could be prince for a day in return your
 band will get some much needed attention
 
 fort lauderdale prince wow havent heard that name for a while i think i
 would do something shocking to get my career back on track like wear assless
 chaps on national tv
i think he already tried that
 
 oh it didnt work man its worse than i thought guess well have to rely on
 the music then id try updating some of the old stuff like annie christian
 from controversy crank up the guitars do some serious steve vaitype
 shit and screech like ethel merman swallowing clorox that should get someones
 attention are you sure about the chaps thing what about crotchless
 
 bronze age fox were working on the most beautiful girl in the world throwing
 in some nice autechrestyle glitch so we can avoid boring people out of their
 minds wondering what we should do next to stop the monotony
 
 hefner dude prince is the king im all over that i think id throw together
 a nice seductive version of controversy pull in a sultry female guest vocalist
 and lay down a chic bass groove smooth as purple cashmere
 
 7 hurtz with peaches and bitch lap lap we used to dance to sexy dancer all the
 time when we were like 13 or 14 so i think we should force people to listen to a
 little skit where we come up with a dance for a danceoff with prince and everyone
 can remember how excruciatingly uncomfortable it was to be 13 and have nothing
 else to do with your life but wonder if your chest would ever be as big as
 apollonia and you could be princes love interest in a big rock movie and sleep
 with a bunch of hollywood execs to prove you truly can act and then do the coke
 thing for a while burn out become born again and go on the where are they now
 hollywood reject boy i regret the things i did when i was in my twenties tour
 those days i was 410 so prince was just the right size so dreamy
 
 the bing dingleberries whos prince
uh nevermind
 
 capitol k prince is god so im not sure theres much to contribute but that
 80s technology is pretty outdated id take something like dance on from 88
 and bring it up to date add some amon tobinstyle drillnbass drum tracks and
 some spastic sound splices and i think well get something pretty groovy what
 do you think do the women come with this gig too
 
 simian how about a morose calliopestyle version of under the cherry moon
 i think the chugging drudgery of the thing would be a clever 21st century
 reinterpretation of princes obsessions with sexual androgyny purple whipped
 cream and cherries as a sublimated early childhood fondling at the hands of
 barney
 
 op1 bastards id sing if i was your girlfriend and really sex it up the way
 a true finnish white boy can then id lay it over some casio organ and keep time
 with corny 80s handclaps and afrika bambaataa beats then id wear one of those
 wicked red sun headbands like that guitarist did in the little red corvette
 video and spank bobby z saying whos your daddy whos your daddy while
 wendy and lisa dripped hot wax down my back or am i asking too much
 
 blue states id work alphabet street into a marvin gayestyle soul record
 not too shabby eh at least its different
 
 broadway project wjeb loy nichols id sing jungle love
that was morris day
 
 what are you serious i was ready to get my posse together hey jesse
 nnow jerome yisssssssssss so i gotta be that punk the kid if you expect
 me to slither around humping the floor it aint happenin that freaks
 perverted man someone ought to buy that guy a pole and lock him in the room
 alone for a few hours you know what freud says about those hysterical types
 i did the same thing for my dog scrappy keeps him off my houseguests now
 morris that guy had class should have given this prince guy the beatdown when
 he had the chance anyway what do you suggest
how about the ballad of dorothy parker
 
 fine send over the chord changes and ill be sure to fuck it up good you wont
 even recognize this shit when i get through with it ill make the vocals really
 distant and rambling and suck all the soul out of it with a super sloppy rhythm
 track just make it into a big wad of crap word
 
 misty dixon i always thought the beautiful ones was a gorgeous song id
 choose that and strip it down give it more of an acoustic sound piano maybe a
 glockenspiel and pull out all of that crazy screaming at the climax it wont be
 princes apotheosis what do you expect but it will still sound pretty good
i dont know if you guys should go through with this i mean covering prince is
 kind of like covering the beatles it sounds like a good idea at the time but
 inevitably you just end up embarrassing yourself and everyone realizes why they
 were so good and youre so well sorry average or worse a few of you sound
 like youll contribute something worth hearing and i think its always helpful to
 hear an artists work reinterpreted either something interesting comes out or
 you gain a new appreciation for the original youve got great songs to work with
 so 75 of the work is taken care of already but im not sure thats worth the
 price of admission i hate to inflate the purple ones ego further but id
 suggest that my friends stick to the originals or if this thing actually hits
 the shelves to wait until you stumble across a cutout in the used binits become increasingly apparent to me over the past couple of years that the
 beach boys are a significant influence upon approximately 58 of todays indie
 rock bands yeah maybe this shouldve been obvious to me a lot earlier but
 bear in mind that my formative beach boys experiences were a 1986 concert by
 the dreadful kokomoera mike love incarnation i saw with my parents and that
 full house episode where john stamos filled in on drums horrifying
 
 even in my recent enlightened state im still surprised at the ubiquity of the
 brian wilson sound given that it only produced one album unanimously considered
 to be a masterpiece perhaps the beach boys continually open peoples eyes to a
 variety of elements the unironic falsetto vocal the joy of nonsensesyllable
 lyrics eg bababas and doobydoos the tasteful blendingin of orchestral
 instruments and the use of crystalline harmonies or maybe todays indie rock
 horde saw themselves as responsible for fulfilling the potential lost when wilson
 surrendered to his insanity and his bed during the smile sessions
 
 wait a minute who is this review about again oh right amfm
 
 to pigeonhole amfm as yet another beach boys homage would be overly simplistic
 the band seems less directly inspired by wilson co than by bands who are
 themselves inspired by the beach boys not to mention nick drake and his legions
 of clinically depressed devotees or more contemporary artists like the coctails
 and death cab for cutie all of the above can be heard in the sonic casserole
 of getting into sinking to various degrees
 
 but still its the beach boys thing that i cant get out of my head and i think
 its caused by more than the duos frolickingthroughsandandsurf cover art
 brian sokel and michael parsell have a knack for dreaming up melodies that sound
 familiar without sounding derivative then tactfully using a wide arsenal of
 instruments to flesh out their vision and its all packaged up with the optimism
 and pep of a premanic depression pinstripe suitwearing brian wilson
getting into sinking bursts out of the gate with the anthemic virgins
 virgins and if we burned all the assholes the earth would look like the sun
 two songs with titles more appropriate for a slipknot album but harboring content
 that glitters with pop sensibility the former combines lovestruck backing vocals
 reverbdrenched guitar and lazy drums into a package so smileyfaced i can
 barely forgive lyrics like there are so many songs about rainbows but whats
 on the other side if we burned has a similar flair carrying a hook like a
 pirateship captain and working up a joyous cacophony by throwing in the some
 elephant six circusstyle horns
 
 the album never again reaches the heights of these opening tracks but bounces
 enjoyably between sunshine daydreams and amfm getting their garfunkel on a
 fairly straight reading of leonard cohens hey thats no way to say goodbye
 and the coffeeshop folk of i was never here two seconds ago missteps come
 from the exceptions to this formula like it fell out of my head where the
 programmed percussion repetitive guitar riff and jarring chants sound like a
 less feminist and less catchy le tigre come suck down a cloud attempts to
 build to a choirfueled climax but seems flat and forced compared to the albums
 simpler tunes
getting into sinking comes off like an album engineered for springtime
 where the increasing temperatures and longer daytimes make even the hardest heart
 vulnerable to a innocently catchy songs viral attack the dozen tracks within
 may not be the most memorable or groundbreaking ever recorded but amfms
 cheeriness is contagious enough to inspire nationwide frisbeethrowing somewhere
 brian wilson tips his firemans hatthe gift of memory is an awful curse
 ben gibbard stability
 aside from being a rather nice turn of phrase this line from the title track
 of death cab for cuties new ep strikes me as oddly universal thats not to
 say it applies to all people or memories but it does bring up an interesting
 point especially with regard to music given that music is a timebased art
 form relying on the passage of minutes and seconds or sometimes hours to
 make its impact and relay its message i sometimes get to thinking about what
 it would be like to listen to music if you had no memory
 im pretty sure i first had this thought while exiting the theater after a
 showing of memento for those of you who havent seen the film it
 centers around a man who after being attacked loses the ability to form
 shortterm memories without those memories attachments become difficult to
 form and his life begins to lose meaning altogether its actually quite a
 terrifying concept
 transposing this to music think about how it would change the way you listened
 to things first youd have no frame of reference for what you were listening
 to it would essentially be pure sound secondly if your frame of memory were
 extremely short say five or so seconds repetition would become basically
 meaningless in the west music relies so heavily on repetition to be successful
 that i think it would be interesting to see how the average pop song would fare
 without that benefit ive often thought that id love to experience music from
 that standpoint for just one day if only to gain a fresh perspective
 of course this isnt what gibbard is getting at rather hes referring in
 somewhat abstract terms to those little nagging memories that we cant seem to
 make disappear no matter how hard we try this is often his topic of choice for
 lyrics but dont think for a second that this is a typical death cab for cutie
 release with these two originals and one bjrk cover we find the bellingham
 washingtonbased quartet exploring musical directions theyve never fully headed
 in before though listening back through their other records you can find hints
 of this direction if you know what youre looking for
 the ep opens with 20th century towers a wasted incredibly slow song that
 hangs on the barest of rhythmic frameworks i know the conscious choice was
 crystal clear to clear the slate of former years when i sang softly in your
 ear and tied these arms around you sings gibbard over nick harmers swelling
 bassline minimal guitar parts and somnambulant drums the songs strange climax
 comes after gibbard sings the line keeping busy is just wasting time and ive
 wasted what little he gave me when the entire band joins to sing only two words
 all around in harmony the guitars become steadily more active after this
 point with gibbard and chris walla each playing a part on separate channels
 making for an interesting stereo effect
 strangely the bands cover of bjrks all is full of love is both the most
 typicalsounding and the most propulsive of stabilitys three tracks
 drummer michael schorr lays down a distinctive beat mostly on his toms
 immediately setting the version apart from the ambient drumless original
 gibbard handles the vocal nicely which isnt really too surprising seeing
 as he and bjrk sing in almost the same range it certainly does not better
 the original but i suspect it would at least work well in the car overall
 it does what a good cover should do it takes a fine original and adopts it to
 the bands own style as opposed to copying it notefornote
 and then theres the 13minute long title track the first few minutes are
 affecting plaintive and slow very much in a similar vein with 20th century
 towers the rhythm is far more insistent and steady though and things swell
 more quickly gibbard is joined by john vanderslice who sings backup on most of
 the songs vocal section after the verses end the song continues for nine
 minutes with the apparition of gibbard singing far in the background and
 wallas guitar playing a sparse part over molasses drums and bass vanderslice
 contributes some synth textures which help things bit but in the end this seems
 like one case where a lack of musical memory might be a good thing that way
 you at least couldnt tell how bloody long it is
 the main problem is that the band doesnt really do anything interesting in that
 nineminute span theres no buildup of tension or subsequent release and
 vanderslice can only offer so much variation with his sustained synth chords and
 volume swells if nothing else i suppose it serves as a decent cure for insomnia
 at any rate it just sort of peters out at the end keeping the ep from feeling
 like a fully realized statement
 for those new to the death cab for cutie camp id say we have the facts and
 are voting yes still stands as the best entry point but the true fans might
 be into this new disc it shows a side of the band that we only rarely get to
 see and only briefly at that some fans may actually own it already if they
 happened to purchase the limited edition first pressing of last years the
 photo album or the japanese import version of that album for those who
 dont stability reveals a promising new dimension to death cabs sound
 that in nonepic doses could do wonders for their future releasestheres something admirable about surviving when you look at the kind of
 people who have made it through the last few decades of music in one piece
 its hard to argue that many survived im not referring to the ones who came
 out clean or who learned their painful lessons of youth and chaotic growth
 actually when i think of musicians like that brian wilson the beastie boys
 and iggy pop to name just a few they dont seem like real survivors to me
 they just seem like they got old and that isnt romantic exciting or even
 evitable
 
 the survivors i love are the ones that made it this far in one piece the same
 piece they started with how rare is it when an artist wields the same powers
 of persuasion and attraction twenty years down the road as they did when they
 made their big bang there are always going to be diehards who support them
 through and through and maybe theres something to be said of the personal
 connection an artist makes with his or her audience that could lead to such
 devotion but there is a school of thought that doesnt believe in that
 chiefly the angels who are impervious to trend age and metabolism are the
 ones that glow brightest for me
 
 now this is idealistic narrow minded and deeply unfair its a plan destined
 to fail so says nature but i picked it up somewhere and its hard to let go
 i can defend some artists using this aesthetic or i can just say that i like
 them because of whatever and leave it at that i can defend tom waits in this
 way i can defend boredoms in this way and theoretically i can defend john
 zorn in this way im not sure i really believe hes still truly surviving
 though he has certainly made it further than most i can also defend kk null
 in this way and though i never have its easy enough
 
 null started playing about twenty years ago and began playing with his band zeni
 geva in 1987 they were a harsh brutally intense band then they still are
 even though i dont always like everything they play null also releases solo
 albums featuring his guitar voice and other tools that are so often frustrating
 disparate artistic statements that i really have to question why id ever consider
 him an admirable person he isnt just making noise but he isnt making friends
 either i cant get a handle on what hes doing all the time even when i think
 its beautiful check a new kind of water his collaboration with jim
 orourke if you suspect me and why wouldnt you but he isnt less difficult
 now than he used to be he hasnt lost the ability to change my mood kk null
 is as powerful an artist not something inherently good or bad but merely the
 basis of my dilemma in this case now as ever and he shows little indication of
 burning out indeed i admire kk null for that
peak of nothingness is at once the embodiment of its title and an act of
 false humility null has packed away his guitar for the vacuum comfort of a
 laptop his press release says bleep core which is as desperate a use to
 insert core into a genre as ive heard especially considering that most of
 the time this album doesnt seem designed to purify or intensify which is what
 i figure people mean when they append core to something anything other than
 nulls interest in new composition it isnt a record that i feel commanded to
 praise though its quite accomplished for someone who supposedly never made this
 kind of music before but it is interesting and it is something that strikes
 similar chords as when i first heard zeni geva i want to hear more of him doing
 this because im curious about where hell turn what mistakes hell expose and
 what he might uncover along the way
 
 two of the pieces on peak of nothingness are quite grating at least
 comparatively speaking the first track none of these songs have names null
 uses running times in lieu of titles here lasts barely over a minute and features
 very distorted panned sounds and a slowly building shudder in the left speaker
 it almost sounds like some kind of interstellar tennis match with perhaps someone
 playing atari combat in the background it leads without break to the second
 track featuring a nonwavering metronome pulse with an ultrahigh sine wave over
 the top the last track is more like the sound of a digital construction site
 with constantly running generator and oscillating power drills its a lengthy
 piece of music most likely improvised as was about half of the album apparently
 and im hesitant to describe it as industrial because of conditioned musical
 connotations though of course it is
 
 the remaining ten tracks are much softer and often display subtlety for which
 null is rarely credited the third track brings back the sine wave and a few
 glitches every now and then but these sound like real glitches ie mistakes
 rather than strategically placed sputters and pops maybe this is the modern
 equivalent to ambient music or maybe its just a buzzing hum that means nothing
 its frustrating and i like it track seven actually increases the volume and
 static and comes close to sounding like fennesz though null has an even looser
 affiliation with melody than the austrian
 
 the fourth track is little but a soft electronic pulse which summons passive
 techno demons by virtue of its consistency but almost certainly accidentally
 track five keeps the consistent patterns but translates them as hypnotic
 dimensional sinoids spinning across the speakers theres a little radio static
 to give the piece color but its quite an impressive use of space with a
 ridiculously limited palette of sound again this record may not be essential
 listening but small pleasures abound
 
 the only drawback with null is that you never know if hell ever return to this
 music again there are so many ideas here so many possibilities to explore and
 yet i wouldnt be surprised if he was already beyond it that said laptops do
 seem to be the way of the world these days and a vital artist rarely wastes an
 opportunity to make a statement on new toys of course null will probably
 survive one way or anotherive never been huge on heavy music peoples individual definitions of heavy
 music vary quite a bit but when i say it i mean music that aims to be heavy
 in the bonecrushing sense usually metal or hardcore i never went through a
 metallica andor megadeth phase in school and i never got into earth crisis when
 i discovered punk i like plenty of noisy stuff but browsing through my
 collection youre not likely to find much that the average listener would call
 brutal
 
 my friends are pretty well aware of this and virtually every one of them has
 reacted with a certain amount of shock when theyve heard mad capsule markets
 blaring from my stereo and its true oscdis may be the heaviest album
 i own yet ive been playing the hell out of it for some reason it speaks to
 me in a way most music of its ilk doesnt
 
 there are a lot of reasons for this and the primary one is probably that for all
 of their stuttering riffs dropped tunings and double bass fills mad capsule
 markets are never lacking in the melodic department which makes listening a lot
 easier it could also have something to do with the cultural filter the music is
 being sifted through before it gets to me see these guys are from japan and
 they approach their music with a certain openminded eclecticism that seems to
 characterize a lot of the music coming from that country these days
 
 i think one of the reasons a lot of americans find japanese music so fascinating
 is that its such an incredibly pure synthesis of influences punk surf
 industrial prog radioready pop and just about any other genre you can think
 of are all treated equally and dont carry the same baggage in japan as they do
 in the us thus mad capsule markets ninth album their second available in
 the states pours all of those genres and more into a 40minute adrenaline blast
 that never gets tiring
 
 released in japan in 1999 this album has already spawned five major hits for the
 band in their homeland and its easy to see why given a fair shake on radio in
 the us i could see it enjoying a similar reign here despite the fact that the
 band veers back and forth between english and japanese lyrics often in the
 same song
 
 vocalist kyono ably alternates scattershot raps deep growls and melodic singing
 constantly switching approaches while bassistprogrammer takeshi ueda and
 drummerprogrammer motokatsu miyagami lay down an intense rhythmic onslaught
 designed to alternately move your ass and pummel it into oblivion the odd
 guitar works its way into the mix here and there but for the most part ueda
 handles everything with his bass dishing up clean elastic lines and
 windowrattling distorted figures with equal aplomb
oscdis opens with the pulsating electronic rhythms and fouronthefloor
 kick drum of tribe before blasting into the first of many blistering choruses
 admittedly the lyrics dont translate that well but the increase in heart rate
 the song provides renders any concerns like that pretty well moot outdefinition
 follows layering miyagamis octopedal kit drumming on top of frenetic drum
 programs and weaving loops of kyonos filtered screaming into the heavily
 distorted bassline to create a dense lowend texture that supports the
 semimelodic rapping taking place in the foreground
 
 n pulse bursts with melodies indebted to west coast surf and old school uk
 punk while the music churns violently underneath injecting thunderous stuttering
 passages after each chorus occasionally the keyboard programming comes close
 to the mutant new wave of the tokyobased band polysics such as on multiplies
 though its always featured lower in the mix the brief mob track is one of
 the few tracks that subverts melody altogether in favor of head spinning
 industrial drum programming and meatgrinder bass not terribly far removed any
 of the hundreds of projects alec empire has put his name on thats a good thing
 here by the way
 
 its followed by the highly melodic surfdrenched all the time in sunny beach
 which features lyrics about literally walking around on a sunny beach a
 hilariously mundane topic when you consider the urgency with which its sung
 this gives way to island the real odd duck in this flock the only song to
 feature guitar prominently it sports verses that could easily be mistaken for
 the slow track on a mid80s jangle pop album complete with ooh ooh backing
 vocals albeit with distorted lead vocals these verses alternate with fullon
 hardcore punk choruses that feel strangely appropriate regardless of the
 abruptness they enter with
 
 the rest of oscdis swings wildly between the thrashing digital metal of
 restart and jag the buzzy junglepunk of step into yourself and the
 almost bouncy poppunk of good girl dedicated to bride after 20 years
 naturally cut though with ridiculously heavy passages that would make blink 182
 soil themselves then it all ends with midi surf an aptly titled number that
 ties together all of the albums musical threads with heavy as hell verses
 rapped prechoruses freakishly fast drumming and a heavily melodic chorus
 sequenced rhythms lurk in every corner of the mix pushing the song even harder
 toward its abrupt conclusion which ends the album in just about the exact right
 amount of time
 
 so overall the mad capsule markets have it going on in spades grabbing your
 adrenal glands and squeezing them as hard as possible god knows what their
 name means i suspect its an odd translation of some sort of drug reference
 but i hope that doesnt keep people from noticing this band like i said before
 ive never really been into heavy music but this gets my full endorsementused to be that a man was judged by the height of his church the advent of the
 gothic era found architects consciously testing the limitations of their craft as
 the european countryside became home to freemasons fueled by religious fervor the
 first inklings of humanism and the sole intent of creating the largest damn
 cathedral this side of bayeux spires crept precariously higher and higher as the
 movement progressed yet many designers continued to adorn their work with
 intricate stonetracery in lieu of buttresses and other such means of foundation
 the logical constraints of gravity that had long antagonized their art no longer
 seemed to concern many as they immersed themselves in embellishment and paid
 little or no attention to the shortcomings of their tools
 naturally many of their achievements were only temporary additions to the
 landscape some crumbled before their completion while others managed to withstand
 only a few years had their designers not been so deterred by an exalted pissing
 contest they may have actually built something with enough stamina and integrity
 to endure times heavy toll it just goes to show you that a little perspective
 goes a long way likewise if a latter day gothic architect were to gaze upon
 the excessive sonic weight bore by any international noise conspiracy song
 even hed tell you that shit was ready to collapse
 with refused the music of dennis lyxzn had a foundation strong enough to support
 the occasional interjections of electronica jazz and whatever other assorted
 weirdness he and his fellow swedes conjured up in the studio in fact by the time
 the group had recorded their swan song the excellent the shape of punk to come
 they had begun to invert the genres oftformulaic sound by cohesively weaving
 whole sections of evocative ambient noise into the mix now having left the safe
 folds of refused for the infinitely more didactic and uninspired international
 noise conspiracy lyxzn and partner lars strmberg turn to derivative song
 structures that try in vain to hold up the unwieldy mix of two effecthappy
 guitars an incessant saxophone clumsy keyboards and lyxzns subpar james
 brown impression for over 45 minutes forgive me if i flee the scene for fear of
 imminent implosion
a new morning changing weather the conspiracys sophomore effort
 showcases the groups ability to liberally borrow from the scorpions spinal tap
 and nation of ulysses without shame born into a mess actually sounds like an
 berrendition of sex farm albeit with an overtly marxist slant much is
 made of the groups communist rhetoric which is exemplified by an admittedly
 impressive reading list contained amidst the albums liner notes but ive yet to
 understand how lyrics such as i blow my mind everyday turn on your love lights
 and let them shine on me is supposed to incite a mass meditation on the flaws in
 modern economic procedure social commentary occasionally surfaces in the form of
 either puerile prose or oblique randomness or sometimes in an uninsightful
 succession of buzzwords an example situations symptomatic define the
 objectified and celebrate the phallic to deconstruct this before we run out of
 time sounds like foucault as interpreted by trent reznor
 the most offensive thing about a new morning is how generic it sounds
 theres littletono variation in tempo instrumentation or aesthetic appeal
 imbuing the album with all the emotional scope of ben stein lyxzn and strmbergs
 exchange of guttural yelps and uhhuhs are sung in a perpetual state of
 overemphasis belying the triviality of their lyrical content even the various
 spots throughout the record in which the musicians are afforded the chance to
 experiment seem nothing more than afterthoughts conceived once the respective
 songs had already been arranged and often come off as nothing more than zoom
 pedal wankery
 lyxzns preoccupation with approximating the angst of teenage suburbia will sell
 a lot of albums amongst the burgeoning screamo crowd will he pull his album from
 the shelves when he hears that capitalism stole my virginity is being played
 round the clock on m2 or at the local shopping mall probably not but from what
 i can discern the international noise conspiracy are at a far greater impasse
 if their intention is to invoke the spirit of revolution in their fans they need
 to offer a coherent and appealing alternative to the status quo and reflect it in
 their music if their goal is to ascend to the upper echelons of hairmetal
 theyre only one virtuoso guitar solo awayhelp me out here people its time we all put our minds together and came up
 with a new name for the genre known as postrock now genre labels are never
 very descriptive and usually serve merely as a crutch for writers and a denial
 target for musicians were not emo a thousand bespectacled bands cry but
 they do serve some purpose as a sort of critical shorthand i tell you a band is
 newwave synthpop and your brain instantly dials up an approximate framework
 for the music at hand
 postrock is an especially faulty term however since it says almost nothing
 about a bands sound other than it being somehow after rock its sort of
 like describing an especially tasty dinner as being postlunch what else can
 we call it then one could go back to the genres obvious roots in king
 crimsonstyle complexity and call it neoprog or something more futuristic
 like progotron if its important to tip a hat to the musics german origins
 amerikraut might catch on or we could all just tell it like it is and label
 it pretentiouscore im open to suggestions
 all this semanticswrassling is provoked by 90 day men an act that many would
 most likely lump into postrock or mathrock circles on to everybody
 their second album the st louis quartet may possibly be addressing this problem
 of classification by naming a track we blame chicago indicting the geographic
 center of postrock with charges of beating the genre into clichdom thats
 just a wild guess and only the 90 day men know the real story behind the title
 but to everybody comes across as just such a challenge to the scene
 the first three minutes of the opening track ive got designs on you led me to
 think that the album had little in store with dianogahs melodic bass don
 caballeros gymnastic drumming and an irritating pinched whine for vocals
 however after eight minutes of bobsled run twists and turns sorry too much
 olympics i was hooked what happened well the addition of brian cases
 textured guitars and more restrained counterpoint vocals didnt hurt but the
 real kicker is andy lansangans piano which slowly enters the fray before taking
 control and allowing the composition to achieve liftoff
 piano you say big frickin deal you say im gonna go see what else pitchfork
 reviewed today you say shut up and sit down i say while the piano might not
 be the most advanced of instruments lansangan uses it to great effect on to
 everybody adding muchneeded warmth and melody to 90 day mens sound where
 the bands previous effort 1999s it is it critical band occasionally
 sank into the sludge of an overly busy rhythm section lansangans inventive
 playing has the band in a much more balanced state instrumentally
 no one song showcases their new strengths like the aforementioned we blame
 chicago a piano and wahwahdriven piece that swoops and darts through two
 tuneful movements disintegrates into noise then returns triumphantly to the
 original theme 90 day men function like a musical assembly line with each
 member playing simple phrases that add up to a cohesive and complex whole while
 many bands that take this approach sound overly choreographed and rigid
 lansangans jazzy style keeps things loose giving off at least the appearance of
 improvisational energy
 st theresa in ecstasy and a national car crash follow a stretched out version
 of the same blueprint slowly assembling an intricate pyramid of sound before
 destroying it all like an angry toddler only to rebuild it even higher while
 the former says less than it probably should over its near nineminute length
 the latter closes the album with a fiery display of tensionrelease dynamics
 if 90 day men have a weakpoint its in their vocals which are predominantly used
 as just another color of yarn to knit into their musical scarf that most singing
 gets buried in the mix is perhaps a wise decision as only the brief aerobic last
 night a dj saved my life reaches minimum singalongability when the vocals are
 too prominently displayed they distract from the music beneath or at worst are
 wincingly melodramatic alligator where the bands prog side gets the best of
 them
 90 day men are also smart enough to know that listeners can only handle so much of
 their dense sinister sound in one sitting and keep the album at a lean mean
 fortyminute length and despite a few missteps to everybody indicates
 that the 90 day men are a band to watch in the amerikraut arena using familiar
 ingredients but to greater effect it may even end up being one of the better
 progotron releases of 2002 what do you think are they catching onif you place any faith in the fork at all if you give any credence to our
 pretentious ramblings if youve ever picked up a record because we told you to
 then please dear readers do yourself a favor stop reading this review now and
 tear yourself away from that spoon album then buyburndownloadstealor
 otherwise get hold of a copy of the shalabi effects the trial of storange
 go listen and then come back because if you dont if you read this review before
 you hear the album itll spoil all the surprises
 yes thats right oh wearied music listener surprises the unexpected when was
 the last time you heard an album that genuinely surprised you again and again
 when was the last time you threw an album on in the background only to find
 yourself torn from wherever your attention was supposed to be focused because the
 music was doing things you absolutely did not expect it to because this is what
 happened to my jaded ass and i havent been happier in ages not only does the
 shalabi effect surprise upon its virgin spin it continues to reveal new elements
 with each consecutive listen but still that initial st orange session
 is a wonderful experience and id rather not rob anyone of it but alas a job
 is a job so for better or worse here goes
 a primal feel is established from the discs opening moments an acoustic guitar
 is plucked as faint percussion falls like raindrops over ubiquitous natural field
 recordings bird songs forest sounds etc placed at far intervals periodic
 gong soundings emerge at first the metal is allowed to resonate in a mostly
 empty space but soon the field recordings grow far less distant
 as we move into the second track sister sleep there are only three movements
 here but there are seven individual tracks the field recordings grow less
 sparse and much louder these sounds dominate the mix effects are added and
 the results are placed into loops soon the random percussion falls into line
 like soldiers at attention rapidfire handpercussion serves as a counterpoint
 for the electronic sounds and fragmented guitar that creep slowly from the
 soundworld like the legs on one of those bugs that show up on humid days in
 basements and garden apartments thus begins a slow transformation from sparse
 yet identifiable sounds into allencompassing ethereal noise its easy to miss
 the certain subtleties in this disc the first time through you dont realize
 what youve heard until it mutates into something different
 this is best exemplified on the next track mr titz the revelator and if
 you were wondering why this album isnt rated a solid 100 look no further than
 that title when the heavenly noise falls out entirely leaving behind nothing
 but a quick repeating bassline theres a very brief vocal sample kicking off
 a race between will eizlinis north indian hand percussion and sam shalabis
 frantically repeated guitar part all the while electronics float about growing
 more comfortable with the idea of structure every minute but the listener doesnt
 realize the development of the electronics part until the song transforms altogether
 into a straightforward drum machine roll taking the movement in a whole new
 direction
 i could gladly go on i could write thousands of words in hope that my meager
 keyboard could replicate the intricacies of the trial of storange the
 way gently chimed bells dance with electric static as faint memories of guitar
 melodies past linger over a background of found sound in a glow in the dark
 or the way that very guitar part will keep repeating adding a new nuance each go
 round until what was once a background element has taken the lead to describe
 every subtle nuance on this album every last unpredictable twist and turn of
 this music would be as impossible as it would be futile this is the sort of
 music that defies description because even if you were to say that the shalabi
 effect fuses elements of canadas burgeoning experimental electronicsmusique
 concrte with psychedelic rock structure and north indian harmonics youd still
 be failing to account for the ambient drones that layer so many moments or the
 tendency to place sparse ammstyle tinkering in the dark spots between wouldbe
 crescendos
 and i did say wouldbe much like that of fellow montreal scenesters godspeed
 you black emperor the shalabi effects music is always building towards something
 gybe takes the obvious way out usually culminating in a grand cinematic blast
 like a hollywood action movie you enjoy it despite its predictability the
 shalabi effect though is the amelie to godspeeds lord of the rings
 veering off on an unexpected path each time it reaches the finale
 which is why im hoping you heeded my advice why im hoping that if youve made
 it this far into the review youve already heard the trial of storange
 because much like an intercontinental cruise or more likely given the pitchfork
 demographic a good road trip with a few close friends in a rusty old chrysler
 the payoff here comes not in the arrival but in the trip itself a review of an
 action movie wont ruin anything because anyone whos seen a couple of them is
 likely to predict the entire plot before the popcorns gone but the shalabi
 effect isnt just another rehashing of popculture cliches theyre as unpredictable
 and original as can be and in todays lukewarm microwavable prepackaged culture
 thats the biggest surprise of them allanyone up on their history of punk rock has heard of them but relatively few have
 actually heard the music they made and this is one of the main reasons rocket
 from the tombs is one of the most mythologized bands ever active for less than
 a year from winter 1974 to late summer 75 rftt released only one single
 during its brief lifespan but its legacy was magnified by the two bands that
 sprung from its ashes the scuzzy dead boys and arty beefheartian new wavers
 pere ubu
 
 ubus dave thomas who performed under the name crocus behemoth started the band
 later adding future dead boys gene oconnor aka cheetah chrome and john madansky
 aka johnny blitz but the man most responsible for the bands mythic stature is
 peter laughner a hardliving lou reedworshipping music journalist who wrote for
 the lester bangsedited creem magazine he was also a promising songwriter
 over the years his songs have been covered by mission of burma and guns n roses
 among many others and a searing guitarist of tom verlainecaliber in fact he
 was being groomed to replace richard lloyd in television when he died of pancreatitis
 in 1977 years of constant drug abuse had simply worn out his body and we all
 know what an untimely death means for an artist mythic stature and as laughers
 rep grew so did that of rftt of course it didnt hurt that pere ubu released a
 series of excellent albums in the late seventies and early eighties
 
 a lot of the discussion surrounding rftt focuses on their milieu i wasnt there
 so i cant say i have firsthand knowledge but my impressions based on what ive
 read and heard is that cleveland in 1974 was an industrial wasteland and a
 cultural desert all mangled metal and shattered glass sprawled upon the rusty
 shores of a lake that was so polluted it periodically caught fire just ask anyone
 who was there at the time theyre almost proud of how shitty it was and rocket
 from the tombs perfectly embodied the bleakness of the city perhaps no other rock
 band has embodied and thus made commented upon its surroundings better its
 something more akin to early 90s gansta rap than anything seen in rock
 
 approaching the band from this viewpoint only deepens their myth but what about
 the actual music does it measure up is rftt actually worth listening to or
 are they just a band to be discussed name dropped and filed away
 
 this 19song comp the day the earth met the rocket from the tombs seeks
 to answer those questions by offering a tantalizing glimpse at one of the greatest
 albums never recorded as the back cover puts it nine of the songs are from
 home recorded demos while the remaining ten are from two live dates the sound
 quality while nowhere near spectacular is consistent and listenable
 
 the easiest way to describe rftts protopunk is as a combination of the stooges
 and alice cooper with hints of sabbath the velvet underground the troggs and
 beefheart altogether its a jarring concoction lyrically they were easily the
 most nihilistic american band since the stooges but rftts music is even more
 arresting than iggy cos in the sense that one can imagine doing something else
 while listening to it say exercising or driving but with rftt all you feel
 like doing is huddling up in the corner or turning it off these are the only
 options this music offers
 
 this comp fittingly begins with a partial cover of the stooges raw power and
 ends with search and destroy in between the band covers satisfaction almost
 beyond recognition and the unreleasedatthetime velvet underground song foggy
 notion all of which have their charms but far better are the rftt originals
 many of which later wound up on pere ubu or dead boys albums or both there are
 nascent versions of the classics 30 seconds over tokyo and sonic reducer
 bearing witness to a great idiosyncratic songwriter thomas coming into his own
 
 but the highlight of the album is laughners oftcovered amphetamine anyone
 familiar with wilcos misunderstood will immediately recognize the lyrics which
 were respectfully lifted from this track nearly verbatim this is the closest one
 can hope for in terms of a definitive recording of this mournful yet unrelenting
 ballad yes a ballad these arent all heavy punk songs in fact in this one
 song you can almost hear the entire career of paul westerberg being born
 
 but back to my earlier question does the bands music live up to the lofty myth
 surrounding it one might as well ask if unrealized potential can substitute for
 actually delivering the goods the answer friends is no
 
 had personality conflicts not ripped the band apart before it could capitalize on
 its members talents rocket from the tombs might have recorded a groundbreaking
 album but they didnt and so all thats left are these fragments left over
 from a bygone era and they can either be mourned over for what theyre not or
 enjoyed for what they are ill choose the lattersong of the sovereign is a retrospective covering the first fifteen years
 of labtekwons career labtekwhat yeah hes definitely gone unnoticed in
 all but indie hiphop circles and he lets you know it more than once on these
 songs but hes not just another mc whining about his holy struggle in the
 underground his deliverys plainclothes at first a sort of brown paper bag for
 all the identities kept inside amongst others guru prophet griot lover
 philosopher and educator if you believe his boasts his diversity means you cant
 pin him down too easily though that may be one factor in his lack of fame
 
 of course you might count the underground as just another crutch for those who
 lack skills an excuse dressed up as treasurefilled crates search for a second
 and youll find those telltale glints of gold you can always identify the
 underground in its opposition to the mainstream culture weaves together
 positive and negative images of africanamericana from bball and the mothers of
 mankind to prison and fornication on the frequent regardless of consequence
 its a solid cut with an upbeat bass groove and pianoroll plinks and labtek
 flows playfully for the most part if you try to step you catch a labteknical
 foul but theres a hint of elderstatesmenofrapstyle preaching talking
 about living like savages and asking fifteen years from now we still going to
 be doing the same rhyme flows from 86 i dont know lab you wrote this in
 94 when you gonna stop with the native tongues licks from the early 90s
 
 thats the main problem across this retrospective labtekwons beats are too
 simple most tracks are built from hiphops barest bones just a looped beat
 and a sample speak on it is from 1996s da helpless won but the
 backing music sounds like a mixtape refugee from the early days of rap theres
 this canned horn vamp that seriously hits on every single beat its unlistenable
 too bad because lyrically labs on an african renaissance tip that would make
 marcus garvey proud i almost cried when i realized black tribes sold out to
 the merchant ships black girls becomes guinea pigs for norplant im tired of
 all of this i begin the war chant he spits ya god damn right i got a chip
 on my shoulder but all i can think about is those horn bleats beating down on
 mine then theres seven uninspired minutes of perversion which drips
 syrupysmooth inflections over a funkadelic bassline no baby you aint dr
 funkenstein take off those starshaped shades and come on down from the
 mothership
 
 so it comes down to the lyrics and most of the time thats enough the man is
 intelligent and articulate and though he rarely raises above spokenword volume
 he cuts off on the rhythm then fires back bobs and weaves whenever necessary
 and doesnt shy from twisted perspectives the last emcee from the 2000 album
 of the same name sketches out a picture in the third person but you know who it
 refers to the stage is set in baltimore labtekwons hometown the plot an
 mcs rise to fame despite its lyrical conceits the song succeeds pivoting on
 spacy synthwork and the discovery that the undergrounds just as filled with
 snakes as the mainstream 1997s baltimoorish science offers up
 perspective whose turntablist scratches dont distract from the cutting quality
 of the imagery embryo grows rise out of the water fluid pours from the comatose
 form between the thighs of a daughter birth canal hurts now no money for lamaze
 classes
 
 theres a nice minimalism at work in the tracks at the middle of song of the
 sovereign most date to the last few years and share a jazzy native tongues
 flavor even if the mood isnt always light in an interview labtekwon said that
 first and foremost hes always been a battle mc i dont hear that and not just
 because theres too few guests on this sampler labtek sounds most at home when
 hes on a mission as on darkside of the sun from 1998s nile child on
 top of crackling vinyl and midnight marauder keyboards he narrates about
 sun tribes and pharaoh phonetics proverbial frankensteins monster from ancient
 times comes the conqueror odysseyin to my epic on king of kings also from
 nile child labtek assumes an aggressive raspy flow and the mantle of
 warrior king dropping the gelatinskinskeleton rhyme before all his followers
 
 in his spare time labtekwon tutors kids and his storytelling skills come clear as
 his best gift his verses are studious but most of the time not academic
 overall hes guilty of overconfidence and singular vision is both his blessing
 and downfall hes got charm from his sun rastyle iwasntbornhere personal
 mythology to a nation of gods and earthsinfluenced promotion of his community
 but its hard to deny that labs beats are boring theyre just too damn plain
 and retro listen to each track over and over and you might start to love them
 but trying to get excited about them is like raising morale in the terminal ward
 im guessing that maybe an actual album might be a better starter before mush
 put together this retrospective labtek said a good introduction would be da
 dawn volume 5 in his extensive selfreleased labteknology series anyways
 check something because hes got his own unique science and its worth it to
 watch it dropsomewhere in the town where you live is a middleaged man whos been in a band
 since his late teens his belly wobbles around under his tootight stained white
 tank top and his oilslicked hair is tied up in a ponytail to pay the bills he
 does sound at the local bar he hangs out at the local record store selling off
 his old vinyl with disclaimers like we almost opened for them once and yeah
 i heard that his sister was really into the band he doesnt have a family aside
 from the four other middleaged men he hangs out with on weekends and the drummers
 13yearold nephew who they recruited when their old rhythm guitarist moved to
 arizona this man likes beer he likes led zeppelin and although hes never heard
 of clinic he fucking hates them
 
 the world is full of aging frustrated career musicians whove struggled their
 whole lives to write a single song that doesnt sound like acdcs big balls
 and yet only one proper album into their careers clinic managed to accomplish
 several of the most coveted goals of rock musicians they amassed a small but
 fiercely dedicated following received almost unanimous critical praise from the
 likes of john peel and they toured with one of the most successful bands in the
 world perhaps most importantly and most impressively they had utterly mastered
 their art
internal wrangler sounded as good as an album like internal wrangler
 could possibly sound and internal wrangler was the only album that
 sounded like internal wrangler having conquered their own unique brand
 of dirty beautifully awkward garage rock clinic was left to seek out new castles
 to storm with walking with thee they venture towards a darker more
 mythical castle but seem stuck halfway between their past victories and their
 new aspirations
 
 lyrically and musically this album is darker and more austere than its predecessor
 while internal wrangler seemed to radiate an immediate nervous energy
 walking with thee is much more detached harmony opens the record
 promisingly with a spooky electric piano and hypnotic bassline providing a
 backdrop for ade blackburns nasal reptilian vocals here the combination of
 blackburns more withdrawn and more decipherable vocal delivery and the similarly
 lucid production works wonderfully the songs ethereal refrain of fill yourself
 with dreams is absolutely haunting and one of the greatest moments clinic has
 laid to tape
 
 the equaliser one of four songs from this album performed in august of 2000
 on john peels radio show and later retitled begins to incorporate the more
 dynamic pulsating energy of internal wrangler with a new darker side
 of clinic but never follows through the moment when all the instruments cut out
 and blackburn intones we hoped for the best and the best then we left so is
 absolutely fantastic but the rest of the song never goes much of anywhere
 welcome once known as the jouster sounds like it could have been taken
 directly off of internal wrangler but the absence of the rough energy
 that helped make that album so incredible leaves welcome feeling a bit limp by
 comparison
 
 the albums title track also bears a very strong resemblance to the bands earlier
 work but the song itself is so good that it would be hard to levy any kind of
 serious complaint against it with a driving beat trademark fuzzy organ and bass
 arrangement and some of the most urgently mumbly vocals to be found on the album
 walking with thee is a short sweet reminder of what made clinic so great in
 the first place sadly the same cant be said for pet eunoch and mr moonlight
 which sound almost like carbon copies of internal wranglers hippy death
 suite and earth angel respectively
 
 again utilizing a repeating electric piano figure come into our room sounds a
 bit like a more subdued version of harmony the same electric piano is coupled
 with the exact bassline from voodoo wop to limited effect sunlight bathes
 our home opens with a slight variation on the opening of internal wranglers
 title track played by a clarinet internal wrangler was an album rich
 with contrast wherever there was a steady fuzzedout organ there was a shifty
 bassline or syncopated drumbeat to underscore it this masterful arrangement left
 the album with a slightly unsettling sense of perpetual motion that seems
 underplayed a bit on this record
 
 finally with its closing track walking with thee picks up where harmony
 left off on for the wars clinic recaptures the cold haunting aesthetic that
 makes the albums opening track so engaging this time as a ballad instead of
 as a jittery rock number dreamy guitars reverbsoaked background vocals and
 some of ade blackburns most affecting lyrics to date make for the wars a
 perfect realization of the newer more crystalline elements of clinics sound
 
 its pretty much a given that most bands work largely from formula if the band
 is good odds are theyre working from a selfcomposed formula rather than taking
 cues entirely from their influences if theyre really good they can mix things
 up enough to keep their formula from becoming transparent on internal wrangler
 and the better parts of walking with thee clinic managed to be distinctive
 without ever sounding formulaic in parts of this albums squishy middle though
 clinic seems far too comfortable relying upon the melodies of songs theyve already
 written
 
 ultimately walking with thee is neither an album of triumph nor of
 disappointment its first and last tracks hint at a new direction for clinic that
 could if fully realized become something utterly brilliant yet much of this
 record remains stuck between the raw vitality of internal wrangler and the
 detached haunting beauty thats hinted at on for the wars and harmony
 thankfully the album is less of a tragic misstep than an awkward straddle and
 at this point theres very little doubt that clinic are perfectly capable of
 turning awkwardness into brillianceladies and gentlemen welcome to a historical journalistic event in an effort
 to properly discuss versus the remix album from scandinavian folk duo
 kings of convenience i hereby create one of the firstever remixed album reviews
 to make this experiment a reality i considered copying all of pitchforks review
 of quiet is the new loud kocs previous album from which most of versus
 material derives and adding a drumbeat but not knowing its writer richard m
 juzwiak ive opted for a different even more revolutionary approach with the
 assistance of sven bjrlykke norways ninthhighest selling electronic artist
 i present to you a live remix of my versus review say hi sven
 hyggelig  treffe deg
 okay lets get started funky drum beat the remix album has long fought with
 the live album for the title of most selfindulgent career move the equivalent
 of a tv sitcoms clip show episodes oonceoonce bass usually consisting of
 clubbedup traxx made suitable for step aerobics and fashion show runways its
 rare to find a remix album that holds allure for anybody but an artists most
 diehard fans
 a kings of convenience remix album however would seem to generate a certain
 amount of curiosity amongst any music fan as the duos usual folky soothing
 aesthetic makes simon and garfunkel sound like megadeth spacesynth eq but
 on versus eirik glambek be and erlend ye enlist a number of umlauted and
 bearing laptop wizards to sculpt their songs into something more akin to the
 kind of stuff astralwerks usually releases given the bands highly minimalist
 style the tweakers are forced to use the subtlety and restraint usually missing
 from remixes tastefully embellishing the songs without being overly distracting
 its unsurprising then that the most effective interpretations are offered by
 the most organically inclined remixers four tet funks up the weight of my
 words with per per per cuss cuss per per per fourfourfourfour
 tet tet per per hey sven i thought we agreed on no glitch
 angre pa
 thats okay its just sort of hard on the reader wood block clicksclacks as
 i was saying four tet take on the seemingly impossible task of funking up the
 formerly wussy the weight of my words using live percussion breaks and turning
 up the bass knob backwards guitar feedback it doesnt sound like much but the
 increased presence of a rhythm section here as well as on reworkings by rokysopp
 and bamboo soul transform the sparse original versions into more realized
 compositions
 adding a low end doesnt change much about kings of conveniences reading glasses
 and turtleneck sound they still generally sound like two guys who deserve to be
 beaten for their lunch money rimshot thanks sven ritons addition of latin
 rhythms and trumpets refashions the girl from back then into the kind of
 softrock most commonly found on beauty salon pa systems bongos and maracas
 later the duos collaboration with erot on gold for the price of silver the
 albums one previously unreleased track indicates that pale norwegians havent
 quite yet mastered the swagger of 60s booty soul
 though cheesy these two tracks at least play to the easy listening strengths of
 the kings material and have an enjoyable sunday afternoon feel hand claps
 only evil tordivel if that is his real name takes the bacharachiana too
 far with a keyboard bossa nova preset ultrafake horns and what sounds like a
 steel drum on his remake of leaning against the wall skatingrink organ fill
 attempts to give the band a rawk infusion however are similarly unsuccessful
 clanking machine rhythm ladytrons fuzzy synths and relentless drum loops
 overwhelm the breathy vocals and like much of their own material grows
 tiresome long before the end of the track
 smooth sax solo
 right sven that reminds me about the kings own arrangement of failure
 which differs from the album version only in its use of sleazeball lounge horns
 and while the brass adds an inoffensive jazzy swing to the song its a nearly
 inconsequential change that only kings of convenience completists would find it
 necessary to hearown wikkity wikkity turntable scratch same goes for the
 string arrangement of toxic girl adding duh strings to the original track
 and the instrumental reprise of four tets the weight of my words remix
 given all this filler versus bears the usual problem of a remix album
 the contents would perhaps have been better released on singles or the best
 stuff put together as an ep electric piano drone but that best stuff four
 tet erot andy votels winning a battle losing the war gives versus
 a leg up presenting a kings of convenience i would actually choose over the
 unremixed version of the band then again the world already has one pinback
 which is what most these interpretations end up sounding like brass fanfare
 this concludes our experiment with remixed music criticism sure to be the next
 critical trend to sweep the nations webzines thanks again to sven bjrlykke
 for helping out say goodbye sven
 pa gjensynback in the 80s when john zorn was namechecking hardcore bands and tim berne was making albums like fulton street maul you could assume that the downtown jazz scene had a lot of anger berne collaborated on zorns spy vs spy one of the most violent records of 80s jazz two alto sax players destroying the compositions of ornette coleman by flaying them with skronky solos and pummeling drums they were kicking off a punkjazz revolution or so it seemedin retrospect no matter how loud or chaotic the john zornknitting factory axis of musicians would get the music was too brainy or too careful to be cathartic rather than combining hardcore with jazz composers like zorn ultimately handled it as just another style to mimic alongside surf music or the works of messiaen in the case of tim berne the cocky swagger of his horn and the snarly twists of his compositions arrived diluted even when berne told his band to shred there was still some chinscratching and careful treading not to mention that his collaborators might throw in everything but the kitchen sink by way of electronics and gadgets he made some good music but song titles like unknown disaster promised something strongerand then came bloodcount in the early 90s when berne assembled this acoustic quartet he finally had a band where he could create decisive and undistracted music played by inyourface virtuosos bernes smooth alto and rumbling baritone sax knocked against chris speeds keening wailing tenor and clarinet bassist michael formanek anchored the band and nowlegendary drummer jim black kicked up a ruckus like a 300pound construction worker unwound still stands as bernes masterpiece with three discs of clear but raw recordings that conveyed every pound of metal and wood and every drop of sweat here finally was a guy who deserved the right to print fuck the kitty on an album coverafter starting his own label screwgun records berne released several albums by bloodcount and by his trio paraphrase an unusually taut and rhythmic free improv combo his latest album open coma presents his first recordings for big band a twodisc set recorded with the copenhagen art ensemble plus his longtime associates marc ducret and herb robertson as featured soloists and its no surprise that for all the colors and nuances of bernes and conductor ture larsens arrangements this band is primarily an instrument of force the great basie and ellington orchestras could get just as raucous but they also had elements of swing and cool that berne has mostly dispensed with at turns rowdy gorgeous and frantically overstimulating its an exciting performance of bernes catchy and intricate writingthe four compositions on open coma run between thirty and forty minutes each thats not an unusual length for berne but its still surprising how tight each piece sounds theres no noodling or open spaces each track is carefully organized into solo small combo and group passages berne can throw more catchy melodies into a single piece than many people write in their lives and he uses as many as seven in the longest track eye contact this piece actually sounded mild and a little thin when bloodcount plus guest ducret first recorded it in 1994 but here with a larger band berne is able to flesh out its beauty and aggressiveness while still setting up some great solo features if the players seem slightly uncomfortable speeding through the knottier group passages they make up for it by slamming through the legend of p1 at full speed the piece builds to rock music intensity and then segues to a rowdy burlesque just add dancers impacted wisdom is a little looser with sections like a calm middle part that emphasizes flute and muted trumpet the title track which is the newest piece and the only one that debuts here has gentler transitions and fewer contrasts and changes the horns swell in waves across the themesthe copenhagen players are completely committed to bernes concept from the more lyrical solos of lotte anker on soprano sax or peter fuglsang on clarinet the latter unwinding his instrument over drifting backgrounds to the rowdier sections like the open horn improv near the end of p1 thomas clausens piano accompaniment dances around the melodies and his distorted fender rhodes adds a perfect rough texture for example behind ducrets solo on open coma of the featured soloists ducret is a fascinating guitarist who has a rubbery tone hes derivative of bill frisell by way of gumby but hes more willing to shred and make some nasty sounds herb robertson is a phenomenal extremely expressive trumpet player his plunger work here is incredibly entertaining as expected from someone whos known to take his trumpet apart in midsolo to get the sounds he wants and as for berne his solos are inventive and tangled wrapping around ideas like a rat snake when he needles into the upper register it may make your ears hurt but let him go hes earned itwhy do you know the name red monkey well you may have seen them open for fugazi
 a while back or you may recognize pete and rachel as members of pussycat trash
 and mainstays of slampt underground but more likely you caught a glimpse of
 an album cover while fueling your secret shame by scrolling through troublemans
 new releases on their nifty webbar catalog hell they may even be old hat to
 you now after six odd years and three albums to their name
 
 alright i was fucking with you you dont know the name and after careful
 deliberation it is my considered opinion that you should not ever want to
 
 i suppose since the title is a line from a familiartobrits nursery rhyme about
 prototerrorist guy fawkes that gets chanted every november 5th were supposed
 to start with assumptions of a politicized worldview but as it turns out this
 record is more about alienationaspolitick seriously if the terrorists arent
 alienated who is here on gunpowder treason and plot the requisite
 and anticipated sociopolitical observances would have had a somewhat mullable
 quality to them if they werent flavored with such selfmutilationinducing
 quasipoetic lyrics
 
 the lazy halfspeaking here is of an especially grating sort i admit i have a
 pretty low threshold for shit like that and tend to give special dispensation to
 famous spinkers eg lou reed travis morrison and mark e smith to get at
 the quality music behind the tonedeaf frontmen red monkey isnt quite in that
 class pete and rachel take turns sputtering or droning into the mike the
 apathy they display in their voices transliterates 100 i soon no longer care one
 whit about what theyre singing and only digest the lyrics through the chore of
 reading them apart from the listening experience
 
 jerky rhythms that do nothing more than prove these simians can count to
 five instead of four are used overused and abused on each and every
 song hey free advice if youre interested in subverting the traditional
 rock reliance on 44 try not immediately setting up another crutch in its
 place it didnt work for the el salvadoran government and its not going
 to work for posthardcore either we liked gang of four too guys please
 respect their memory
 
 when the music and unmelodies almost work the lyrics dont sewing from
 ground down and vice versa jazz step forwards the result is an album
 out of sync with itself perhaps red monkey got too distracted worrying about
 trying to nail their time shifts to miss the fact that the separate components
 of the album were evolving away from each other or maybe they just havent
 figured out yet that while art can be a vehicle for political expression a
 guitar isnt a megaphone and an amp isnt a soapbox either way it results in
 a incredibly trying forced and uncohesive ten songs
 
 hearing to this album i get the sense that red monkey is a much better band to
 experience live as bad as this material is they do have a good sense of
 dynamics going for them and a presence more apropos to the stage than to
 plastic for example the single noteworthy track courage in this now is
 an epic blast and has a bringdownthehouse potential that could very likely
 be positively incendiary in a sweaty shouldertoshoulder environment
 
 but after reflecting on gunpowder treason and plot via the headphone
 experience deprived of the boosting charisma inherent in a live setting i
 realized what it is that i now find intolerable about bands like red monkey
 for all their efforts to be different theyre all playing the same notes and
 riffs over the same stock edgy beats and singing along to it with the same
 adolescent gripes same as their own other songs and the same as other bands
 so what makes this approach inferior to say an equally blunttoafault
 throwback punk band like antiflag antiflag sound like theyre enjoying
 themselvesamon dl ii rose from the communal pit of amon dl i a group of beaters and stompers who made three albums culled from the chaos of a single tribejam session the second outfit saw the madness in that situation and decided to do their own thing and not worry about getting a new name or fighting too hard for the first one guitarist chris karrer took with him seven of the collectives best musicians and they formed what is generally thought of as the better half of this family theyre usually aligned with faust not really a good comparison can getting colder and neu might as well say frank sinatra but if indeed the band was ever typical krautrock they were decidedly closer to the rambunctious progrock side though comparing them to yes is even worse with a liberal dose of heavy psychamon dl ii was infinitely darker than most of their countrymen as well with songs or more accurately suites often running the gamut of protogoth subjects aliens funerals alien funerals they did it all of course none of it would matter much without some seriously engaging music i first got into amon dl ii after a friend had compared boredoms super ae to their 1970 release yeti and though thats a convenient reference the german band were the far hairier proposition pounding rhythms acidattack guitar freakouts inappropriately wet reverb overdoses and strange lyrics about hg wells and toothpaste all contribute to the general strangeness that is an experience with the early works of this band1971s tanz der lemminge dance of the lemmings was the bands third album and though theyd already taken the pedal off the spacy overdriven metal a bit its still a sight removed from the pop charts by that point only karrer john weinzierl guitar lothar meid bass falk rogner organ and peter leopold drums remained from the original group plus a few guests though that didnt stop them from filling up their second double lp in a row the sound is something like old school jethro tull uhhuh though sansflute with so many odd sonic detours as to make the prospect of not one not two but three fullgrown epiclength gothprog tunes and some group improv to boot not as daunting as it could be and for the record this stuff rocks the haussyntelmans march of the roaring seventies at almost 16 minutes is actually the shortest of the epics on lemminge unlike can whose tago mago was released shortly after this album amon dl iis lengthy pieces are generally fleshed out works rather than pure studio concoctions and pastiches of improvisation or shorter segments syntelmans starts ominously enough with a wall of chimes and distant organ tones but the insistent bass and drum groove boils to the surface with karrers acoustic guitar which is a major component on the album and one reason why it feels less a hazy workout than previous releases working over top and even some light mellotron sounding like a choir of children to give it scifi charm after a long introducing you can listen to the story says the singer and so another light acoustic guitar interlude brings in the next section the band may have been influenced by space oddityera bowie as many of the pieces featuring songlike sections are reminiscent of bowies more whimsical outings all things considered this is a pretty warm introduction to the band if you were so inclinedrestless skylighttransistor child begins with one of about a hundred classic riffs featured on lemminge and if theres one major difference between this album and its predecessors its the noticeable increase in major league hard rock riffery this leads to a completely different though equally classic riff and to still another riff after that the last one though brings it down a notch and even introduces some nice sitar to the mix where this band has distanced itself from the other krautrock bands is its unrelenting eclecticism and variety in its arrangements even faust couldnt claim as many points of reference points as this tune after the rocking intro it goes to ghostly freak ambience then to musique concrte broken carousel onto berfoghat territory with riffs aplenty then to something that sounds like it was ripped off of the first funkadelic album with hendrix guitar and big beats and then a crazy gypsy violin goes apeshit seethe final grossewerk is perhaps the centerpiece of the record chamsin soundtrackthe marilyn monroe memorial church where the previous pieces were long they werent necessarily mindexpanding which is what i expect from the best amon dl ii and this piece makes up for that in spades beginning with cloudy undefined organfeedback ambience and with a little ancient violin lament here futureshock noise there it is positively haunting percussion enters sporadically though this piece is certainly not about groove romantic heavenly organ repeats what the violin only hinted at earlier and im taken to the next plane in spacerock pretenders usually wuss out by including some ridiculous spoken word thing or even worse start playing a guitar solo not these guys after the organ more sound affects and disembodied instrumental embellishments ensue with the most horrific being the pounded piano about twelve minutes in as psychedelic noise symphonies go this is in a class all by itselfthree shorter pieces end the album most likely as sobering agents after the preceding journeys chewinggum telegram is a fairly standard early70s hard rock jam while stumbling over melted moonlight takes out the funky trash and introduces the best demonic riff black sabbath never played the end of the tune turns everything inside out as the drums get filtered through what sounds like a telephone wire and the guitar is replaced by weightless organ the closer toxicological whispering continues the endjam though with a lazy repetitive riff more suited to closing your eyes and letting life drift by than just about anything elsethis is not my favorite amon dl ii record but it may be the best introduction to the band records like yeti and phallus dei are fiercer and certainly louder but dont really cover the ground lemminge does and in fact the band did slowly recede into commercialism throughout the 70s though by no means immediately as the two records after this one were almost as good so its possible this record just marked their transition into a calmer gentler beast but a beast

 gradssome albums have to grow on you is it a clich because its true or is it true
 because its a clich dont ask me man i didnt come up with it all i know
 is that i waited a long long time for the twin atlas second fulllength kitchen
 usa to stand out from the slew of crap that usually resides at the bottom
 of my tobereviewed stack but on what seemed like the infinith listen the
 bands homebrewed yet refined folkrock sound something like if the elephant 6
 explosion had happened in wales instead of the american south finally hit
 the twin atlas is as you might assume from the name a duo sean byrne who drums
 for both lenola and mazarin and lucas zaleski and one of many bands wrestling with
 the specter of multicity collaboration but if their fecundity is any measure
 theyre handling it pretty well there are 22 tracks on this album and 26 on
 their outofprint debut 2000s the philadelphia parking authority must die
 representing a nearly unbroken streak of recording from january 1999 to march of
 last year
 these are short songs but they do have a great thematic consistency phrases
 both musical and lyrical repeat throughout and some tracks are permutations of
 earlier ones lending the whole thing a loose concept album feel without actually
 taking that grandiose pretentious step the end result is that by the end of
 the record you feel an instant familiarity with the music nice
 but while any dart thrown randomly at the kitchen usa could strike a
 potential college radio hit there are definite highs and lows one of the
 standouts is when the dawn survives a song that takes the most simplistic
 organ hook imaginable and layers it with guitars mandolins maracas and some
 genuinely moving and evocative lyrical muscle but if you dont laugh out loud
 at the lofi stylistic parroting of everyones least favorite pompous irish
 rockers on where the feet have no name ill give you a buck intentional or
 not people dont need any more instrumental u2 in their lives
 still the gorgeous harmonies on kitchen usa if thats your bag are
 truly the centerpiece here and they generally deliver the goods sean and lucas
 voices blend perfectly complementing each other like a true classic pop pairing
 its easy like sunday morning just give it timethe aging of hiphop presents a serious structural dilemma similar to the one
 rock and roll faced a few decades after its inception if a genres narrowly
 targeted at the kids what happens when those kids grow up most of rocks
 pioneers hit middle age in the 1980s their responses to this dilemma sucked
 more than a modicum of ass with none sucking more of it than bowie and
 jaggers near careerkilling rendition of dancing in the streets
 
 so far goldenera hiphop hasnt fared much better among the many whove fallen
 include qtip whose formerly enlightened selfawareness has regressed into a
 shocking lack of the same ll cool js meaty ass bought a ticket on the suck
 train several years ago accomplishing one of the most thorough sellouts in
 recent memory and i recently learned from vh1s behind the music that busta
 rhymes has heeded the advice of an oracle named pdiddy altering his rugged
 selfimage to become hiphops estrogenfriendly answer to barry white though
 you certainly wouldnt know it from his current single break ya neck
 
 it appears from their latest release aoibionix the second in their
 aoi trilogy that de la soul has managed to steer clear of similar
 ignominy the trio now in their third decade of existence are well beyond the
 expiration date of some of their goldenera peers but just when you thought de
 la too might go sour see the trilogys first installment they hit you with
 the unexpected and in doing so they provide an obvious answer to the dilemma
 target a new demographic
 
 the new audience clearly likes things smooth they appreciate family love and
 maturity theyre the same group whove accounted for the explainable success of
 dangelo the unexplainable success of bilal and possibly the neverending
 barrage of morris chestnutlaced black middleclass motion pictures including
 such blockbusters as waiting to exhale the wood and the best
 man wheres my man taye diggs straight up aoibionix takes a
 belt sander to hiphops rougher edges resulting in refinement sophistication
 and undeniable accessibility
 
 the first single off bionix baby phat draws from that eternal font
 of hiphop inspiration the shapely beauty of the black female physique its beat
 is oddly reminiscent of toni braxton but that said its tight and matches the
 breaks in the rhymes simply a superior party anthem takes familiarity to the
 next level sampling wings wonderful christmas time in the most glorious manner
 the groove is smooth and will undoubtedly be the soundtrack to some of the finest
 soul train lines to come held down features ceelo and a gospel choir with a
 soulful vocal chorus delivered over a classic walking bassline a la al green
 watch out is more emblematic of the de la of old although the beat is built
 around a vibraphone it hits pretty hard and the rhymes are direct and incisive
 
 but before we get too excited about bionix we must address its shortcomings
 which are belated but apparent on what we do for love washedup gay pimp slick
 rick once again manages to annoy and disturb as if to provoke riots de la soul
 match rick with an electronic harpsichord should have matched him with a muzzle
 the situation doesnt improve much in the last few tracks as breal displays a
 masterwork of character development on peer pressure playing the challenging
 role of a conniving drug pusher you go b
 
 in short aoibionix is to hiphop what grover washington jr was to jazz
 its smooth wellproduced wellexecuted and palatable and like grover its
 probably a lot better than you thinkoriginally these guys were just plain witch hazel now theyve changed their
 name to the witch hazel sound with a name like that you can tell these guys
 want to be thought of as something different theirs is a unique sound man
 one unlike anything youve heard before one deserving of a name all its own
 
 ahh if only this were the case if only this album were unique then id know
 what to say about it at best i could heap on gushing praise at worst i could
 tear it to shreds with my most vicious turns of phrase but the witch hazel sound
 is quite unfortunately not really worthy of its own subgenre theirs is a brand
 of poprock weve heard a thousand times before yet another in a seemingly
 infinite line of wouldbe 60s poprockers born a few decades too late indeed
 the witch hazel sound is almost indistinguishable from say the elephant six
 sound its one made from layered instruments and harmonies one full of horns
 and organs and backup singers its not even a bad sound really just one that
 begs the question does this really need to be done again
 
 which leaves me in a tough spot whats to say about an album like this world
 then the fireworks that hasnt been said a thousand times before about a
 thousand similar albums i suppose i could tell you about the arrangements but
 the bands liberal use of trumpets saxophones and organs which seem to exist
 only to supplement their otherwise traditional sound are just not that spectacular
 i could talk about how the vocals and musicianship are remarkably competent though
 never anything more and i guess i could talk about the neat little flourishes
 the groups adds here and there like the way kiss me monster begins with one of
 the most familiar words in all of 60s poprock hello darkness and continues
 with traditional vocal harmonizing and a wistful aesthetic yet somehow manages
 to do it in a way that doesnt seem derivative of simon and garfunkel or hey
 while were on the subject i could even tell you about the guitar part that
 plays backwards over the end of kiss tomorrow goodbye creating a sound thats
 at once familiar and alien maybe i could gush about providence a charming
 instrumental right out of a cartoon comprised entirely of organ and vibraphone
 
 friends i could mention all of these things and in between i could use
 phrases like jangly guitars or harmonies like a summer breeze but that
 would leave you without any knowledge of the lyrical content which predictably
 consists of your standard innocuous pop song fare this incidentally would
 be better left unmentioned and what of the song structures shouldnt you be
 told that with the exception of a few short instrumental numbers and the simple
 yet charming guild of splinters theyre about as predictable as they come
 
 yes you should be told and you should also be told that the witch hazel sound
 while often painfully unremarkable arent truly deserving of critical beatdown
 because along with being too ordinary to love theyre also far too pleasant to
 hate this after all is a decent bunch of reasonably talented guys and the
 music they create is certainly harmless enough they never get as toothrottingly
 sweet as the apples in stereo in their most grating moments nor do they ever
 succumb to the absurd pretensions that occasionally drag down of montreal yet
 without such possibility of failure lurking over their shoulders the songs on
 this world then the fireworks ultimately all sound a bit too alike in a
 market glutted with 1960s style pop music these guys seem designed to fade into
 the background and i realize that youre reading this because you want me to

 james hardway and it incorporates many of the afrocubanisms that dominated his
 previous album moors and christians into the jazzy drumnbass of earlier
 outings
straight from the fridge launches into the st germainstyle dancefloor
 jazz of happiness brakes to a bucking accompaniment of grimy hammond b3
 organ stabs invader of the heart clive bell sends flute curlicues flitting above
 and in between scurrying muted horns the track is so deftly syncopated that its
 44 kick drum stomp is almost superfluous for earth runnings harrow sets up
 spacy synths that lurk in the background and wisp past vocalist jb bells
 sultry spokenword vocals
 andreas chimes is a gorgeous piano doodle that
 segues into the worldweary voice of floyd batts and his danger blue lament
 here hardway has sampled batts song originally recorded in 1959 at the parchman
 mississippi state penitentiary and surrounded it with xylophone lines and
 burdensome shackles of piano chords fortunately the song avoids the oafishness
 that usually accompanies discofied blues hollers hardways setting is so
 complimentary and seamless that if i didnt know batts vocal was an incorporated
 recording i could not have guessed
 ghetto priest makes a couple of appearances here too ripping loose some fiery
 dancehall chat over the kind of fierce acoustic bass that should by now be
 familiar to longtime hardway albums priest gets nuff respect from me by
 referencing both admiral baileys casiotone raga classic jump up and death in
 vegass digital rudie jump and twist throughout jump up natural he also
 proves himself more than just a rasping raggamuffin during the consciousness

 similar to the one heard in sinad oconnors fire on babylon the

 as hardway records go straight from the fridge is succinct and infectiously
 strong unlike previous outings this record rents no space to noodly weaklings
 such as our cousin frank from a positive sweat im already thirsty
 for another frosty cool one from hardways iceboxits a bit of a stretch but a while ago i compared boards of canadas seminal
 music has the right to children with miles davis kind of blue i
 wasnt saying anything about the similarity or relative quality of the actual
 music of course i was just making an observation about how each album has a
 remarkably wide appeal that stretches beyond fans of its respective genre while
 simultaneously carrying great weight with more experienced and discerning
 listeners because of this dual nature both records are considered ideal first
 purchases for those curious about the musical world they come from the comparison
 fails in other respects but theres no doubting the consensus of opinion that has
 formed around these records shared among both newcomers and schooled aesthetes
 
 the reputation of music has the right to children has everything to do with
 why geogaddi is one of the most anticipated records of 2002 for indie and
 electronic music fans of all stripes its been four long years since this
 scottish duos landmark debut and during this time weve seen an uncountable
 number of kind of like boards of canada bands drifting by with only a toddlers
 handful of new material released by the boards themselves namely the in a
 beautiful place out in the country ep released in late 2000 as marcus eoin
 and michael sandison toiled away in secrecy in their hexagon sun studio and
 remote artists compound fans speculated about possible new directions where
 would they go next
geogaddi provides a clear answer not so far really as similar as this
 album is to the rest of the bands catalog it seems a safe speculation that the
 concept of reinvention is not part of the boards of canada mo their
 exceptionally distinctive and oftimitated sound emerged fully formed on the early
 eps and for now at least theyre sticking with it while some will complain
 about boards of canadas failure to cover new territory which puts them apart
 from the praised eclectic searchers of the music scene miles made only made
 one stab at kind of blue before moving on after all the rest of us will
 delight in what we see as a very accomplished album packed with great music
 
 when it comes to discussing records though similarities are boring so lets
 talk about what makes geogaddi different the first thing that comes to
 mind is the shift in mood while the band continues to traffic in childhood and
 nostalgia the atmosphere on this album is a shade darker than on previous
 releases and comparatively tense with a noticeable thread of paranoia boards
 of canada have always had a disorienting cast to their music in part because of
 their proclivity for the quivery modulation of their analog synths but where the
 warbles once seemed designed to evoke the sensation of strained memory the
 distortions now have a disturbing undercurrent suggesting that something
 frightening might lie beneath the surface
 
 part of this darker trend comes from a thicker production environment and apparent
 aversion to unused space on geogaddi boards of canada have replaced
 silence with the drone and the master tapes are saturated with the sounds of
 the duos customized machinery theres none of the wistful airiness of a track
 like turquoise hexagon sun nor the lighthearted warmth of a music has the
 right to children track like aquarius gone too is the gentle pastoralism
 of in a beautiful place out in the country
 
 in its place we find the swirling claustrophobic winds of julie and candy
 menacing swells of feedback anchoring the rhythm of dawn chorus and the lonely
 isolated nuno cannavaroisms of the devil is in the details whose two sampled
 voices are a crying baby and a monolog given by a woman who might be drowning
 some of the beats on geogaddi compliment this new darker undercurrent and
 stand out from previous work the pummeling mechanized drum loop that drives
 gyroscope is downright violent and seems squarely aimed at the distorted childs
 voice in the background and on alpha and omega hints of tabla mix with
 multilayered percussion lending an intriguing live band feel to an otherwise
 unremarkable track
 
 so yes the boards have implemented their trademark tools on geogaddi
 but in the service of a slightly gloomier vision granted the familiarity of
 their sound could prove to become a liability on their future releases but its
 easy to see why eoin and sandison have played this record so close to the vest
 if youd perfected a sonic playground like this youd probably want to explore
 it a while longer toothe art ensemble of chicago is one of the most enduring units dedicated to free improvisation and modern jazz composition in existence they began as a series of projects led by saxophonist roscoe mitchell a member of the illinoisbased nonprofit association for the advancement of creative musicians which is dedicated to nurturing serious original music in chicagos black community in 1968 after working with several small groups mitchell found himself with a great lineup himself naturally bassist malachi flavors trumpeter lester bowie and saxophonist joseph jarmanat that point the group was still known as roscoe mitchells art ensemble and they actually recorded a couple of early records for both the nessa imprint sound which debuted what would become the defining sound of the aacm and delmark numbers 1 2 ironically the group wasnt even known as the art ensemble of chicago until they relocated to paris in 1969a jackson in your house recorded june 23 1969 and message to our folks august 12 1969 both just reissued on one disc from actuel records were originally recorded in paris for the byg label and before percussionist famoudou don moye had joined the band for the most part the music on these early records is a direct indication of the kind of projects the musicians had previously been involved with free improvisation counterpoint and modern european classical music traditionally minded attempts to integrate african music into their sound a significant theatric influence the combination of these elements immediately distinguished the art ensemble from almost every other improvising group of the time but there was more to them than that their embrace of vaudevillian humor sometimes delivered in the form of strange spoken word sections or rough skits lent their records a unique kind of levity that couldnt be found in the ultraserious expressionism of peers like albert ayler and pharoah sandersthe first record begins with its title track and encapsulates many of the art ensembles strengths though in somewhat sprawling form fauxtheatric whimsy classic jazz forms and even some strange form of world music and all in five minutes but the song while definitely offering an interesting overall mixture of sounds can be a tad too much for me at times things come together better on the next song get in line here the group again relies on the vaudevillian opening with a rollercoaster head not unlike something you might hear on a john zorn bebop record and gradually transforming into a burlesque march while someone shouts out the tracks namesake then with no warning whatsoever begins four minutes of prime chaos saxes go ballistic like predatory beasts malachi flavors busts out blistering acoustic basslines and what little percussion there is spins wildly out of control next thing you know someones sounding a gong like the cops raiding a party with hoses and smoke bombs and the track grinds recklessly to a halt intensethings get much more civil on the waltz a very short though typically referential waltz spotlighting the bands ease with restrained arrangements while hinting at the bawdy dignified oldtime jazz these guys obviously love too bad the tune is just over a minute long because its easily the most focused on the disc the other tracks are quite daring and even passionate but possibly rough drafts thats not a crime especially in jazz but it does make it just a tad harder to take in all at onceof course song for charles is the centerpiece of the first album and not just because its longer than all of the previous tracks combined it begins as an extension of jarmans delicate beat poem ericka but dissolves into free lyrical phrasing from the horns and bass with flavors sounding eerily like a rather wired scott lafaro soon a vibraphone enters as bowie and mitchell turn a small figure into a very emphatic fivenote melody proclaiming who knows what grandeur this moment of clarity is quite brief though as the group improvisation quickly begins and in full exploratory mode the mammoth session seems like abstract impressionism but what impression sometimes strange and distorted sometimes cold sometimes resembling a traditional jazz torch song especially during bowies soliloquy about nine minutes in this is heady stuff and though i can hear the dedication in the performance sometimes the feeling loses methe second album on the disc message to our folks opens with an arrangement of old time religion replete with an introductory sermon and responses from the congregation ominous bowed bass and cymbal splashes allow the exposition to hover until the proper tune kicks in the horns hold steady all the way up until the last minute when they drop a hard swinging head but already this record feels a lot more serious than a jackson in your housecharlie parkers dexterity gets the postmodern treatment quite a feat back in 1969 as bowie and mitchell play the tune straight enough but blow a hole through the speakers during the solo there are grunts an accompanying triangle and even something like bebop drums and they pull a similar stylistic leap on rock out which sounds like an abstract take on james brownstyle soulfunk the bassline actually feels curiously lifted from i got you i feel good and whoevers playing drums is doing a mean jabo starks impersonation things really get interesting when mitchell comes in with a mean solo spikier than anything maceo parker blew in those days since the art ensemble were trying to unite so many forms of great black music a term coined by the aacm to describe its own musical direction but also applicable to so many other artists bringing in funk and rock was a natural stepagain the band ends with a sidelong piece a brain for the seine this is no less challenging than song for charles was and is in many ways further adrift of contemporary jazz even in the avantgarde bowie begins with a somber muted statement with what sounds like an accordion and jingle bells helping him along this very clearly breaks into distant percussion speaking and something like tools banging against wood please may i have a drink of water says one narrator and a zither sounds bowie removes the mute flavors bows ever persistently and still more exotic percussion and mallets make entrances and exits perhaps this is a treatise on economic symphonic arrangements or maybe theyre just that eclectic to include so many timbres in a short time span and even at 20 minutes they manage to get in more than most artists do in three albumsthis record a logical progression from a jackson in your house as well as major source of sampling for amon tobins 1997 masterpiece bricolage seems to have more at stake than its predecessor but both serve as a good indication of the heights the group would scale over the course of the next few decades step forward have patience and be ready for anythingthe divine comedys neil hannon openly admits in interviews that hes never
 actually read the book his band is named after ive always found this somewhat
 amusing especially considering how literate the man is otherwise hell his
 second album has a track that consists of nothing but him naming off great
 authors over a baroque arrangement and his first ends with a wordsworth poem
 put to music
 recently divorced from the setanta label amicably hannon shows up on parlophone
 with a sevenpiece band including himself apparently ready for a change in
 direction for regeneration hannon more or less leaves the orchestras
 and superhuman wit of past offerings at the door mostly opting to treat the
 divine comedy as a selfcontained band for the first time since their disowned
 first album fanfare for the comic muse back then the group was still a
 guitarbassdrums trio on the northern irish club circuit
 to help realize this relatively strippeddown approach hannon and his newly
 solidified lineup called in berproducer nigel godrich who at the time was
 fresh off helping radiohead realize kid a and amnesiac godrichs
 recent work actually surfaces in quite a few places on regeneration
 though the little ambient noises and the tapemanipulated wash of sound that
 close eye of the needle represent the only time they really come to the fore
 those same atmospheric flourishes color the edges of much of the rest of the
 album though giving it an overall sonic unity and depth that works well in the
 absence of the usual soundwall present on divine comedy records
 the album opens with one of hannons reliably depressing musings on life and time
 entitled timestretched theres not enough hours in the day to say all that i
 want to say he sings later offering that theres not enough lines on the stave
 to capture the music i crave his distinctive low baritone sounds as good as
 ever and throughout most of the album he remains considerably more reserved in
 his delivery than he ever used to steering clear of the manic yelling of charge
 or the cheeky operatics of sweden on the one hand this aids the lowkey
 subject matter hes dealing with here but on the other it makes for a rather
 less interesting listen
 that said theres not a bad song to be found anywhere on this disc and it
 remains engaging for nearly its entire duration only falling into the background
 in a few isolated spots mostly though theres gold aplenty to be mined from
 a song like perfect lovesong which comes close to making good on its title
 give me your love and ill give you the perfect lovesong with a divine beatles
 bassline and a big old beach boys sound he proposes just as joby talbot
 launches a recorder countermelody sweet enough for sloop john b its matched
 by understated glockenspiel and echoing auxiliary percussion all on top of a
 loping easygoing beat that makes it hard not to bob your head
 note to self follows with slinking guitars and a steady beat before breaking
 into the crashing bridge where hannon cries out what the fuck is happening
 like he really doesnt know monday restate my assumptions heaven and hell do
 not exist go the songs opening lines and the band does a fine job of echoing
 that uneasy sentiment with the music the mix is densely layered and multiple
 listens reveal small blasts of feedback squirming keyboards and other disconcerting
 noises which buried throughout the song heighten anxiety with their subtle
 presence
 lost property plays with imagery naming off raincoats tennis rackets and
 other lost objects as a metaphor for the passage of time and moments that really
 matter to us over arpeggiating piano and a subtle string arrangement the
 aforementioned eye of the needle follows with stuart bates treated trombone
 blending with electronic effects for an unusual background texture hannon reels
 off some great imagery and commentary with lines like the cars in the churchyard
 are shiny and german distinctly at odds with the theme of the sermon the
 songs spartan arrangement and placement in the middle of the album work together
 to provide some needed variety and segues perfectly into love what you do the
 albums most obvious single the verses are doused in glockenspiel and
 wellblended synth and recorder while the chorus positively soars on electric
 piano ostinatos and fluid bass
 the rest of the album is characterized by somewhat colder textures like the
 guitars that dont really sound like guitars on the chorus of dumb it down
 and the meandering piano on mastermind the second verse of dumb it down
 bends and warps with postproduction effects a surprisingly avantgarde move
 that works quite well mastermind is subdued and largely acoustic aside
 from sonarlike sound effects hannon ends it with the line all the dreams
 that we have had are gonna prove that were all mad and thats okay
 the title track gets even chillier on the verses with icy piano and hushed vocals
 and even refuses to warm up when ivor talbots guitar rips it open for the two
 bridges the beauty regime closes things off on a warmer note with its 70s
 rbinfluenced rhythm section and ultimately inspirational message hannon tears
 into the plethora of modern imageoriented magazines that clog the shelves these
 days exhorting the listener to forget everything theyve read there and just
 live life its strange how such a ridiculous cliche manages to sound convincing
 coming at the end of an album like this the thing is no matter what he says
 hannon sounds utterly sincere and thats what really drives his message home
 in the end regeneration turns out to be a validating listen much like
 the divine comedys past efforts its certainly a lot less melodramatic and
 thats both a strength and a weakness the music is great and the honesty is
 refreshing but sometimes i miss the old hannon insecure but brash nonetheless
 and witty as hell the past aside regeneration delivers and often
 brilliantly dante would be proud even if hannon still hasnt read his bookonce upon a time erik sanko was the frontman for a band called skeleton key
 skeleton key was pretty cool they wrote good rock songs and banged on garbage
 cans capitol records took notice they signed skeleton key and then as often
 happens in the music industry they fucked the band thoroughly and vigorously
 skeleton keys one proper album fantastic spikes through balloon got
 less than no promotion failed to gain the kind of support it no doubt wouldve
 garnered from an indie label and was later yanked out of print skeleton key
 lost their limbs on the battlefield of alternative music and it turned out to
 be a fatal wound
 
 in the military they have the purple heart for people who meet such a fate a
 thoughtful kind token to say hey dude sorry we sent you to have your knee
 blown off in nam a gesture of appreciation for someone who was screwed over
 in service the music industry has never been particularly good about showing
 appreciation for its soldiers unless you consider jethro tull fuckin hardcore
 the grammy is essentially a joke awards are only given to the socalled heroes
 of the business but what of the wounded what recognition do the poor souls who
 have been reduced to collateral damage by the thoughtless machinations of the
 record industry receive erik sanko and his bandmates should have at the very
 least each received a medal depicting in fine bronze and gold engraving a
 musician being brutally raped by a smiling record exec
 
 fortunately a little piece of metal probably wouldnt have mattered all that much
 to the boys of skeleton key who have since gone on to plenty of other projects
 junk percussionist rick lee and drummer steve calhoon formed enon with exbrainiac
 guitarist john schmersal and now frontman erik sanko has returned with a
 pleasant if not terribly exciting solo record on a friendly little label
past imperfect present tense is a solo album in the truest sense of the
 term every single note on the album is composed and played by sanko himself
 given that erik is primarily a guitarist with an interest in keyboards and
 strange noises it makes sense that this record would be a more subdued effort
 than the tattered junkyard jams of skeleton key indeed sankos guitar and voice
 with some additional atmospherics provided by subtle effects and keyboard
 flourishes constitute the albums core sanko is without question a talented
 man both as a performer and a songwriter but despite the fact that past
 imperfect sprung entirely from the loins of a single creator
 it only occasionally registers as particularly affecting
 
 when it does register however it does so with remarkable elegance and style
 there are a few moments here that are absolutely intriguing the shaky slithery
 synthesizer part that appears throughout the perfect flaw is utterly entrancing
 and the track is this incarnation of sanko at his finest subtle downcast and
 vaguely haunting hints of this run through the album as a whole but are rarely
 developed enough to yield truly potent results
 
 much of past imperfect seems to rely on a similar formula a sparse
 usually minor guitar figure a shaky vocal melody and some atmospherics thrown
 in for good measure sanko manages to use this recipe to pretty good effect too
 on occasion such as in while you were out a song that occasionally bears an
 uncanny resemblance to the live version of radioheads like spinning plates
 with that train sanko picks up the pace a bit but the spartan arrangement and
 lack of change in dynamics tethers the song to the tag pretty good
 
 aside from a few deeply hypnotic moments sankos isolation doesnt really seem
 to help past imperfect much a more diverse range of sounds would have
 benefited the album greatly as sanko surely knows the music world can be a
 cruel horribly unfair place its best not to face such things aloneback in the day i couldnt listen to any music that wasnt super high in fidelity
 i was weaned on pop radio and anything less than the best sounded like
 chickenscratch it took me a few years but eventually i came to appreciate the
 immediacy of more raw recordings now i have a distaste for music that sounds
 too glossy it works in intricate electronic music and rb but when i hear a
 rock band with that overproduced sheen it leaves a bad taste in my mouth its
 hard for me to avoid the sense that theres a certain lifestyle being sold along
 with the music im just glad my tastes turned tail because five years ago i
 might have been all over this stuff
 
 the zincs isnt so much a band as it is the work of one man jim elkington aka
 jim zinc hes from london but like so many mystifying brits his accent
 virtually disappears when he sings elkingtons voice sounds rich and worn with
 age a weathered old bastard like paul weller or mark lanegan but his music is
 a twangy breed of rockandroll that seems sure to have come out of the rural
 american midwest yet the ohio gold label is actually based in chicago elkingtons
 current home
 
 the zincs might get accused of being altcountry but the little details elkington
 spreads throughout his songs keep the album from being pigeonholed as part of the
 no depression scene i remember begins with strange whining electronics and
 elkingtons vibrant fingerpicking halfway through the song shifts suddenly
 into searing guitar distortion then back to the melody before this short slow
 little introduction ends two patients picks up with a bender of a groove
 punchdrunk guitars swerving back and forth across the lines set down by the bass
 and drums i had forgotten what it means to be scared elkington sings but he
 sounds far from cowed
 
 never endeavour reveals a more vulnerable side jim breathes reassurances well
 weather together away from the cold and the soft guitars and drums fade into an
 organ solo that restates the main melody really sweetly on opening time the
 deliberate snaretick and acoustic strum paint a lazy picture that doesnt need to
 be elaborated upon beyond the song title elkington asks close your eyes were
 they closed all the time and the mellow slide guitar admits as much its a
 drinking song and there seem to be a few of them on moth and marriage
 but while each is worldweary theyre also heartwarming whisper in the well
 is built around a dismal chorus theres a whisper in the well tonight soak
 this parasite but the meandering guitar jangle tambourine and repetitious
 hook make it dirge so good
 
 x in executor cranks the volume as elkington yowls distortedly into the mic and
 layers of guitars weave together in pure woweezoweeera pavement chaos
 with the album closer in the hallway elkington returns to the experimental
 vibe stroking the nylon strings of his guitar into a complex melody that slows
 to a crawl and ends in forlorn harmonica notes while he pockmarks his songs with
 odd electronic touches and drones here and there elkingtons first and foremost
 concerned with songwriting and he never takes himself too seriously theres a
 current of dry humor running through the record as on the bossanovatinged the
 elemental where he takes a dive towards selfmockery show me the list of
 affectations i can do all of them without a stop i guess the zincs name came
 from the galvanizing property of the ore i listen to this on the way to work in
 the morning and it gives me a boostis it electronica chopped up into pop songs or a collection of hookless pop that
 props up gorgeous electronic effects its hard to be absolutely certain but i
 can tell you one thing for all the work that went into their debut british band
 south failed to fully deliver on their hype sad too because from here on
 in is inches away from being a success its just that its weighed down by
 so many repetitive textures and songs that fail to impact
 
 joel cadbury handles most of the vocals and routinely swaps drums bass keyboards
 and guitar with brett shaw and jamie mcdonald and on a few of these tracks
 they make a straightforward britpop combo you can hear echoes of some 90s
 manchester bands like the stone roses and possibly a less glamourstricken suede
 and the piano and vocals particularly on keep close are reminiscent of john
 lennon or at least julian but the guys only turn out one solid rock song the
 orchestral paint the silence and the appealing but derivative here on in
 the latter a summerday power ballad with acoustic guitars and pastoral keyboards
 builds to a beautiful aching climax while cadbury intones the chorus surrounded
 by smashed drumkits and mangled guitars with songs like this south has the
 potential to be a great blisspop band
 
 but pop isnt enough for south and when they hit the studio things got a little
 crazy south coproduced the album with james lavelle the head of acid jazz
 label mowax which released from here on in in britain and the man
 behind unkle he collaborated with dj shadow on the 1998 hit psyence
 fiction an album widely recognized for sounding great but not actually being
 great but possibly due to lavelles influence or maybe their own excessive
 facility in the studio south was a bit liberal with the sounds and effects on
 this album and not necessarily in a good way in fact many of these songs
 mercilessly work a beat without ever taking it anywhere
 
 the instrumentals have a driven pace but they end up as static variations on a
 groove if youll pardon my soulprofessor terminology south includes three
 separate versions of broken head each longer and less interesting than the
 last all in for nothing reprise kicks off with a terrific drumbeat and
 soaring keyboards or guitars but loses its effect after stagnating for the
 remaining four minutes many of the pop songs are also drowned with texture
 all in for nothing becomes vague and indistinct as the band turns it into a
 canvas for the beats and keyboards even some of the simpler songs suffer from a
 short attention span keep close already works as a straightforward song but
 the guys cant resist the urge to play with the vocal mix or tack a gloomy
 instrumental onto the end
 
 this is even more unfortunate considering that the band actually sounds
 terrific the drumming is crisp and limber and i cant get enough of their
 basslines occasionally they hit a song with everything theyve got and it all
 comes together sight of me segues well from the slower body of the song to a
 solid dance outro but the overall impression is of long stretches with little
 to warrant attention the arrangements are muddied by too many textures and the
 tracklist relies too heavily on dirges such as the backtoback woe of recovered
 now southern climes and by the time you catch your heart with a running
 time of seventy minutes all the good parts get buried
 
 last year south worked with lavelle on the soundtrack to jonathan glazers sexy
 beast and if youve seen the film youve heard the stuff south excels at
 slightly lofi atmospheric music thats great in small doses and works well behind
 scenes of criminals breaking into vaults and dreaming about hairy monsters but
 the best musical moment of that film comes from punk band the stranglers during
 the title sequence theres a shot of ray winstone several pounds overweight with
 his leathery bare gut hanging out over tight speedos stumbling next to the pool
 as his groin hangs in the middle of the screen for way way too long the stranglers
 play a little song called peaches whose concise drums and raunchy organ mocks
 the scene perfectly if south had pushed themselves to make one great moment like
 that or really anything that evokes images of rays fleshy thigh we might have
 had something a little stickier on our handsthere are styles of music that i figure will probably always be around in some
 form and psychedelia is one of them i have a lot of reasons for thinking that
 but the main one is that as a genre its so adaptable the advent of decent
 recording technology was one of the main things that made truly psychedelic music
 possible in the first place so it seems natural that the music should continue
 to evolve with the technology secondly psychedelia is at best a vaguely defined
 genre distinction so its easy to apply it to music that comes decidedly from a
 rock or pop standpoint but is colored on the edges with noise and effects
 the tadpoles pretty much exemplify what most american psychedelic music sounded
 like in the 1990s melodic rock wrapped in blankets of fuzz heavily processed
 guitars and the occasional electronic studio effect the tadpoles were adept
 enough at jamming and developing themes but they were at their best when working
 with concise punchy songs then they broke up in 2000 indefinite hiatus they
 called it and leader tom parker pulled together this retrospective as a eulogy
 of sorts for the band by and large hes come up with a good overview of their
 catalog taking four tracks from each of the bands four studio lps and one track
 from 1997s know your ghosts ep
 the 78minute disc starts where it logically should with four songs from the
 bands debut album 1994s he fell into the sky and proceeds chronologically
 from there as such it gives a clear view of just how much the hoboken nj band
 progressed during their career snapper opens things in a haze of stompbox fuzz
 with parkers tenor voice hanging low in the mix original drummer michael kite
 audino lays on the toms hard and the sheets of distortion sometimes give way to
 cleanly strummed guitar chords and even something that might be described as a
 solo at one point albeit not a very melodic one
 the vocals stay fairly buried and the guitar tones largely the same for the other
 three selections from he fell the best of which is probably the slowburning
 the ride which features some fine playing from bassist david max and a gloriously
 muddy buildup near the end the four selections from 1996s far out show
 progress almost immediately with nick kramers heavily processed guitar coming
 to the fore after the departure of coguitarist andrew jackson
 race you to the mustard patch drips in wah pedals and vocal effects while the
 nick kramersung nazareth remains squeakyclean until about 2xbd minutes in when
 it briefly explodes in a ball of distortion and flailing lead lines ride the
 world around the sun features dueling guitars orbiting a solid bassline while
 at least im not like jonathan carver begins floating somewhere in space before
 congealing halfway through into a heavy aggressive attack
 the portion of the disc devoted to 1998s excellent smoke ghost album is
 probably the most solid portion of the compilation as the band finally hit on a
 combination of songwriting and sound that balanced the two equally kramer puts
 his voice out in front for know your ghosts and the band allows for considerably
 more space in the arrangement setting up some dramatic guitar breaks jaded
 jean could easily have been a single falling into the same noisetainted pop
 territory that the jesus and mary chain nurtured in the 80s
 both parker and kramer had come a long way with their singing by this point which
 allowed them not only to handle better rangier melodies but also gave them the
 confidence to put them up front in the mix a move that greatly increases the
 immediacy of the songs the only disappointing thing about this section of the
 disc is that parker has chosen not to include smoke ghosts excellent opener
 when i feel which is easily one of the bands best songs still the propulsive
 effectsdrenched firecracker is a reasonable substitute if not an ideal one
 judas this is jesus from the know your ghosts ep follows breaking the
 chronological flow for a few moments but its unlikely that any listener would
 mind as the song doesnt sound like a step back at all it begins with an
 answering machine message of a man saying judas this is jesus its raining
 silver help me a clip that reverberates over the course of the whole
 instrumental which is otherwise a sticky concoction of molten guitar mayhem
whirlaway the bands final album and their only effort not recorded for
 their own bakery label had by far the clearest sound of any of their releases
 incorporating more keyboards and electronics and largely eschewing the fuzz that
 typified their early work instead the distortion on crash of the bug is more
 controlled and less opaque the guitars take on more melodic tasks too soaring
 in tandem behind the verses and bridging the gaps between vocal passages final
 drummer adam boyette lays down a furious groove on that albums title song giving
 max the chance to toss off an impressive bass lead at one point and ably supporting
 the fluid guitar leads
 unfortunately the last two tracks each find the band gazing a little too hard at
 their shoes ending the disc on a fairly unengaging note but overall use with
 headphones late at night is a satisfying look at the tadpoles studio career
 perhaps the most unfortunate thing about it is that it only focuses on their
 studio material neglecting to include a single track from the tadpoles destroy
 terrastock an ep documenting their ferocious performance at the original
 ptolemaic terrascopesponsored terrastock festival in 1997 as far as
 definitive statements on what the band was capable of at their best that ep just
 may be it
 aside from that though theres little to gripe about this is in the end a
 faithful overview that serves as a fine introduction to one of the great overlooked
 psychedelic acts of the 90s of course it also catches them wandering here and
 there but by and large use with headphones late at night concentrates on
 the bands most focused work for most people this is all the tadpoles youll
 ever need you may still want to try and catch them destroying terrastock
 thoughstop me if this gets sappy and it might because selected ambient works 8592
 recently reissued by pias america was the very first electronic music i ever
 bought and certainly the first i ever heard over and over again long ago before
 i was old enough to drive i would sit in a small cluttered bedroom in my parents
 suburban ranch house absorbed for hours by the sounds contained on this disc the
 creeping basslines the constantly mutating drum patterns the synth tones which
 moved with all the grace and fluidity of a professional dancer the strange noises
 that id be unable to identify even if i tried back then aphex twin was making
 music like nothing id ever heard before
 whats become apparent since is that i probably wasnt the only one affected
 after last years disappointing drukqs its easy to forget that back in
 the warp records heyday richard d james was to this new breed of ambient and
 electronic music what babe ruth was to baseball sure there were upstarts
 xb5ziq squarepusher and autechre were all on the scene by the time this collection
 hit shelves but james was still the posterboy the presumed ringmaster
 singlehandedly defining a style of music in the minds of many now as a new
 wave of mostly twentysomethings step to the forefront of idm redefining
 electronic music for the third time in a decade it becomes more and more obvious
 just how far reaching james influence was
 theres nothing new about this rerelease aside from improved availability and
 decreased cost but then improving on this package would be near impossible sure
 the music on selected ambient works 8592 may sound a bit dated as does
 to be fair most electronic music more than a few years old but theres no
 denying it was the defining statement of warps early years and the foundation
 for the careers of bands like boards of canada and plaid
 the songs here are not ambient in the same way as those on this discs sequel
 technically most fall into brian enos broad definition of the style it can
 be appreciated in small segments just as much as in its entirety the music
 develops slowly unafraid to linger on a particularly effective sound for as long
 as necessary the creeping keyboard loop of schottkey 7th path for example
 is continually modified throughout the course of the song but never once
 eliminated from the mix but james would never be content as a mere follower in
 anyones footsteps his work here serves a model for what would come to be known
 as traditional idm a simpler version of the style weve grown accustomed to
 certainly but idm nonetheless
 james early work is heavily indebted to early dance music filled with beats so
 eminently danceable as to confuse those who only know him from the spastic drum
 patterns that came later theres little of that here though selected ambient
 works 8592 is rather an album stretching back to the days before software
 allowed for heavy sampling or glitch technology drum machines serve as its
 backbone and synthesized bass and keyboard sounds provide the meat most of the
 songs follow a relatively basic formula as well one element say a synth melody
 is introduced and repeated and as new elements are added with each go round the
 song gradually builds to a dense multilayered swirl this ravelesque approach
 flavors much of james older material and yet despite the simplicity of his
 equipment and approach the songs here are both interesting and varied ranging
 from the dancefloorfriendly beats of pulsewidth to the industrial clanks and
 whirs of green calx
 indeed these early works do a fine job of showcasing james ability to transform
 even the most seemingly mundane patterns into something unique and interesting
 hedphelym for instance is built around a relentless headachethrob clich of
 a house beat but james surrounds the pulsation with an ethereal feedback that
 bleeds all over the track leaving the percussion awash in a murky solution of
 synth tones pairing dance music with ambience in ways the orb never dreamed
 possible
 slightly more structured and equally enjoyable is we are the music makers a
 track which follows a drumbeat and a bassline past a pair of intertwined synth
 loops and a repeated willy wonka vocal sample as simple keyboard melodies pour
 down from overhead but the aforementioned green calx is the closest selected
 ambient works 8592 comes to the spastic trickery of which james would become
 such a pioneer it matches pitchshifted tones and drum machines with a burbling
 bassline assorted machinegun synth interjections the slightly effected tones
 of various pistons motors and machines and even the occasional cartoon spring
 noise moments like these serve to foreshadow both james later work as well as
 the infinitely more complex twists and turns that idm would make in the years that
 would follow
 they say next to no one heard the velvet undergrounds first album when it was
 released but everyone who did went on to start a band listening to selected
 ambient works 8592 one cant help but imagine the seeds being planted in the
 imaginations of the lucky few who were there when it all began nestled in these
 simple undeniably danceable tracks are the roots of contemporary idm and despite
 its somewhat primitive origins the final product remains among the most interesting
 ever created with a keyboard and a computermontreals abstract electronic community is quite the busy little scene right now
 with the mutek and fcmm festival showcasing the citys laptop and posttechno
 artists the city seems to spawns another star every week and this week its
 scott montieth congratulations scott
 
 deadbeat is the appropriately ambivalent alias montieth has adopted for
 primordia his dubinspired pop crack and fuzzmatic debut for the
 intrversion label so why should anyone take any notice of montieths
 contribution to a style already bloated beyond sustainability simply montieth
 is an accomplished manipulator of sound and a swell storyteller
 
 i approach primordia in two similar ways either as a narrative about decay
 or as an icecore drills journey through millenniaold packed ice whether the
 album is actually about radioactive decay or glaciology im not certain but
 these have served as useful metaphors and tools by which i have come understand
 and appreciate this seventrack collection i acknowledge that all of this sounds
 horribly pretentious but since this music is definitely more oriented for the
 whitney than prepared for ricks roadhouse bar i think that im meeting montieth
 headon like if hes being intellectual and artistic enough to describe brownian
 motion or the extent of 180 accumulation the glaciers of greenland then i should
 at least attempt to match him
 
 away from my adopted narrative approaches primordias seven tracks are
 immensely pixelated versions of jon hassell and brian enos possible music
 with units of distortion and fuzz glide and drift much like hassells manipulated
 trumpet and the beats here are similar in that they exist out of any time keeping
 construct in possible music nana vasconcelos and aiyb dieng use their
 ghatam an earthenware pot percussion instrument featured extensively in south
 indian classical music and congas to comment on and emulate hassells and enos
 drifts of sound montieths beats are similarly conversational
 
 but beyond the winking selfeffacement of the name deadbeat montieths moniker
 serves to state that his beats dont function like the ones on dance records in
 this regard montieths beats are indeed dead yet in his primordia
 montieths vision of the pristine state of existence his beats are very much
 alive and fully functioning as much freefloating uncoalesced entities as his
 fuzzedout drifting synths while not exactly revolutionary primordia
 does have the rare quality of being as malleable and fascinating as the mind of
 whoevers listening and that can go a long wayin i am sam sean penn plays a retarded man who loves the beatles theres only one other problem hes losing custody of his sevenyear old daughter lucy diamond dawson from what ive heard about the film and i havent seen it because lifes too short penn continually quotes beatles lyrics and tells anecdotes about the band so the natural tiein is a soundtrack album of beatles songs of course licensing the original songs would have been prohibitively expensive so in lieu of john paul george and ringo this disc features fab four covers by seventeen artists and bands mostly pooled from contemporary pop charts and adult alternative radiobecause these recordings were made for the film they cant really be faulted for sticking pretty closely to the originals and eschewing any wild interpretations after all these bands arent competing with the beatles versions theyre attempting to replicate the songs in a manner which not only suits the film but also remains accessible to the general public not that theyre winning any points with us for that but it does shed some light on why these songs turned out the way they didwhile its true that many great musicians have recorded powerful and creative interpretations of this music the bulk of beatles covers have been little more than slavish imitations and of course thats what we end up with here most of the performers on i am sam lean on the beatles arrangements and never bring anything unexpected to the table sarah mclachlan faithfully runs through blackbird on an acoustic guitar eddie vedder echoes the weary tone in lennons voice on youve got to hide your love away ben harpers performance of strawberry fields forever even recreates the songs string section verbatimgranted the vines im only sleeping manages to radiate a little energy and ben folds shows up with a pretty take on golden slumbers with strong vocals and nice orchestration but elsewhere things are pretty dismal the black crowes faithful but dull rendition of lucy in the sky with diamonds and the wallflowers middling im looking through you are both painfully prosaic chocolate genius reworking of julia sounds expensive with its crisp drums acoustic guitars and rough vocals but ultimately comes off plastic and heather nova we can work it out and sheryl crow mother natures son are just lousy they dont even sing well hereinterestingly enough the one band that actually tried to do something inventive with any of these songs flops miserably grandaddys reworking of revolution dumbs the melody down to the bands own standards with jason lytles colorless disinterested vocals and extraneous keyboards effects doing little to motivate listeners to the songs namesake a commendable effort maybe but still an ineffective oneand then there are the highlights aimee mann and michael penn turn in a fair reading of two of us with wellcrafted production in place of the strippeddown original rufus wainwrights across the universe is unremarkable but at least brings some conviction and earnestness paul westerberg and howie day play acoustic versions of nowhere man and help respectively and the two songs work well with their backtoback sequencing and unexpectedly nick cave actually improves upon paul mccartneys schmaltzy let it be with his understated sincere vocalsregardless these more passable moments are far outnumbered by the boring andor intolerable ones listeners will probably like and buy this soundtrack if they dig the bigname performers all of these artists have their fans even sheryl crow and if youre one of them you might enjoy this record after all it does exactly what it was meant to do but with the beatles that just doesnt cut itdo you hear that now dont turn around somethings coming up behind you
 its coming closer and closer and closer no its not john ashcroft and his
 legion of lawless thugs though he might have a question or two for you if youre
 of middleeastern descent the above sample begins dancing in the pockets of
 thieves warped distortion sounds accelerate and a disembodied voice croaks
 not wanting to be found this short intro segues to the brutal rage of cement
 is blue it sounds like hardcore punk thrust through an oscillating fan what
 with the constant clang of the drums and the noxious guitar my hands are tied
 together frontman russell white screams over and over and while the repetition
 gets too barbaric the tense guitars and humming synth build up and then betray
 with a short ending
 
 michelle maskovich and russell white formed champagne kiss with jesse johnson
 after moving to minneapolis the duos new band carries on like a continuation
 of their time in san diegos camera obscura a band that left only one document
 to change the shape of an envelope which was rooted in the san diego
 hardcore scene yet branched out towards broader influences like fellow
 diegodwellers clikatat ikatowi camera obscura were willing to experiment
 jamming keyboards samples and piano into the mix their songs were more
 polished than their kin and they coupled whites shouts with maskovichs
 understated backing vocals a step in the direction of rock seemed likely
 
 if anything dancing in the pockets of thieves is even more abrasive im
 staring at the strange retro fashions on the cover all neon lines and angular
 skyscrapers and listening to the midi beeps and looped crying sounds at the
 beginning of stereo relapse but then the track busts with a thick seam of
 guitar buzz and white screams about plastic consumption and reflective
 addictions the roland keyboard bleeps raw melodies oddly appropriate for the
 seething emotions the electronics are leveled so earsplittingly in the mix that
 you barely notice at first that the drums are all programmed the aesthetic
 develops into an industrial process combining remnants of newwave primitivism
 with postpunks linear minimalism and suddenly im feeling reaganite paranoia
 all over again monarch syndicate pummels with endless crashes of percussion
 as the guitars mass together and uncoil in screwloose chaos
 
 hardcore was a uniquely american reaction to punk and cold war suburbia in the
 1980s defiance channeled through raw sonic force a sense of community and
 brotherhood champagne kiss offer up just a hint of that affirmation during the
 chorus of black violin as they raise their voices and guitars en masse voices
 echoing each other awkwardly and shouting this is the last time but then
 white descends into emo diary drama squealing about bleeding diamonds hands
 are screaming voice confessions that are bleeding theres this breathy
 voiceover can you hear that sounds like rozz williams fucking around on a
 christian death bside the problem isnt just the loss of any sense of hope
 its that the alternative nihilism doesnt sound as scary as they want it to
 80s centric is the sound of a band lashing out at all that disgusts it but
 tripping over itself dont need another hex on my head white yells and the
 battered drums and shrill synth crescendos sound more campy than creepy
 
 according to the liner notes dancing in the pockets of thieves was
 recorded in thirtyeight hours i wish theyd taken more time their tech
 obsolescence and brittle robotic rhythm is in turns menacing and appealing but
 this album doesnt contain any one song as amazing as camera obscuras
 cinematheque a surging wave of noise counterpointed by maskovichs faint
 couplets deconstructing genius comes the closest defining the phrase synth
 stab while the guitar tingles edgily and white whispers panicstricken with
 your filled prescriptions screamed lyrics are buried far back muted and
 metallic coming out of some valiumlike haze and after a few minutes of silence
 another section begins full of hyperspeed snares and lonely piano the guitars
 play with knifeedge funk and the band throws in voice samples about a research
 paper on the pharmacological properties of soma half an hour is too short to
 tease with this kind of acidic commentary but at least the place theyre coming
 from makes sense these days remember all the americans shocked at terrorist
 attacks during a time of peaceget ready key pitchfork demographic 1825 year olds youre about to become
 the target of an oldies campaign given the evershortening waiting period for
 nostalgia hey man remember when the patriots won the super bowl its just a
 matter of time before the first hits of the 90s radio stations start popping up
 across the country and when seether starts rockin the airwaves again you
 better believe verula salt will be touring americas lowcapacity venues perhaps
 coheadlining with neds atomic dustbin and jesus jones
 
 nine years removed from their biggest hits cracker would seem to be statefair
 circuit material themselves yet to their credit david lowery co appear
 to be trying their hardest to avoid this fate and remain a vital relevant act
 with their newest album forever of course when your bands lasting
 image for most people is the lead singer boxing sandra bernhard thats an
 uphill battle to be fighting
 
 crackers secret weapon against obscurity apparently is to take refuge under
 the rootsrock banner releasing forever on the virgin imprint back porch
 records and wearing a whole lot of denim in the album art while perhaps a
 further insult to hardcore camper van beethoven fans desperately praying for
 lowery to turn around his musical deevolution the choice at least reflects a
 purpose more thought out than hey remember us please please please buy our
 new album but rootsrock itself has always been something of a questionable
 cause usually implying something along the lines of were tired of experimenting
 lets just make music thats already been made a thousand times before
 
 save a few exceptions thats mostly the vibe forever projects with the
 band whittled down to a core of lowery and guitarist johnny hickman content to
 reside along a familiar countryrocksoul axis youve got your acoustic guitar
 base your occasional slide guitar fill your dylanesque organ your chugalug
 drums and your mildly catchy melodies it would be offensive if it wasnt so
 obvious that cracker doesnt aspire to much more than this rustic middleamerica
 mediocrity act
 
 or do they mark linkous returns the favor of lowery cowriting the brilliant
 sparklehorse anthem sick of goodbyes by producing the leadoff brides of
 neptune and tweaking crackers sound by throwing some eerie synth voices and a
 tinny drum loop into the mix and while its not quite jim orourke reinventing
 wilco it is a compelling opening to the album hickmans lone solo composition
 superfan also augments the cracker formula with an underlying drone and some
 baba oriley violin indicating that hes more than just lowerys hiredgun
 soloist
 
 but then again experimentation also gives us what youre missing a selfreferential
 joke that painfully allows these crackers to nearrap about their respective roles
 in the band that sound you hear is biggie rapidly spinning around in his oversized
 solidgold coffin humorous intention or no can we please put a ban on white rock
 bands rapping
 
 elsewhere lowerys singing voice retains the same old onedimensional inflexible
 rasp which given the uniformity of the music works more often than not less
 successful are attempts to soften it with twobit sheryl crowish harmonybacking
 vocals which give shine and guarded by monkeys a distastefully slick sheen
 in fact the albums overall polished countenance doesnt seem to jive with the
 bands supposed rootsy goals
 
 so no forever isnt the album thats going to rescue cracker from the
 discount used bins and return them to radio prominence but at the very least
 it establishes them on the respectable side of the soontobeoldies continuum
 more our generations cheap trick than our doobie brothers and something tells
 me thats about all theyre shooting forthis heat were many things but popular was never one of them its almost funny
 to see this record getting so much deserved attention recently due to its reissue
 because before now i only knew a few people who had even heard of the thing its
 especially strange to see all the praise in light of gareth williams death on
 christmas eve last year he wasnt a person who ever really wanted to be famous
 or even known as a musician and yet will doubtlessly be better known henceforth
 than hed ever been during this heats existence
 
 english drummervocalist charles hayward fresh from working with brian eno and
 phil manzanera in the avantprogfusion outfit quiet sun formed this heat with
 charles bullen guitar clarinet viola etc and williams bass keyboards
 tape manipulation etc around 1975 hayward had worked with a fairly broad
 array of jazz and prog bands and postthis heat would continue to do so
 though bullen and williams were much less traveled even as they were accomplished
 musicians hayward and bullen had been playing together as a duo for a few years
 prior to this heat and began playing with williams only after hayward completed
 his duties with quiet sun williams would actually leave the band before this
 album deceit was released and maintain a very busy career as an engineer
 for john barry and various symphonic recordings his interest in recording
 techniques may have provided the impetus for this heat to experiment with tape
 loops and editing which would play very large roles in their studio output
 
 this heats sound was something like a confrontation of prog freejazz and
 contemporary electronic music think early stockhausen not kraftwerk they
 often get lumped into the postpunk or even just punk camp for no better
 reason other than they started at the same time they certainly sounded as if
 they were angry about something and taking a glance at the lyric sheet for this
 album and youd better as often the vocals seem more musical element than
 communicative force they had fairly intense politicalsocial statements to
 make though pinning down their position is often as hard as pinning down their
 sound in any case they were progressive in the literal sense of the word
 and though they came up with the first wave of punk they didnt really sound
 like anyone else of the time save a few other english radicals like henry cow or
 art bears occasionally
deceit was the bands second and final album not counting posthumous
 releases including the excellent bbc session release made available
 as odd as it sounds on the surface its actually the more immediately appealing
 of their two albums at least partially because of a greater emphasis on drive
 and something like song structure though the music here is quite a ways from
 typical songs the vocals mostly handled by hayward were probably the
 weakest link for this heat though they dont really take away from the music so
 much as push it into yet a stranger realm
 
 sleep the first track is actually an atypically calm song almost like a
 fractured lullaby layers of what sound like african percussion and a simple
 piano line support a very lowkey melody wherein lines like softness is a
 thing called comfort doesnt cost much to keep in touch we never forget you
 have a choice make me wonder if there isnt some kind of subversive commentary
 about consumer ethics and advertising at work this shortly leads to the raveup
 paper hats with its brawny pouncing rhythms and subtly acrobatic guitar lines
 this is a piece with several sections none of them having too much to do with
 each other some like the lengthy outro sound like archetypical mathrock
 with repetitive complicated rhythmic patterns while the brief middle section is
 more viscerally dynamic or perhaps even noisy lyrically the band was as
 eclectic well what do we expect paper hats or maybe even roses the sound
 of explosions oh no id like to know what they expected but im not sure
 what they got instead and am certainly in the dark about to whom they protested
 
 triumph is a dadaist collage of various noises musical and otherwise theres
 a brief accordion intro leading to what sounds like a kazoo lament accompanied by
 someone scraping a few pieces of metal and wood together then hayward mentions
 something about the angles being reversed and the garbage symphony makes its
 grand conclusion all in less than three minutes perhaps this was a prologue
 for spqr which throws out any ideas of abstract noodling in favor of pure
 rock expression the highspeed beat threatens to overpower a droning duo vocal
 line we organize via property as power slavehood and freedom imperial purple
 pax romana this track doesnt run through a myriad of stylistic changes it
 makes its case via sheer persistence
 
 haywards interest in all manner of world rhythms and percussion manifested itself
 in tracks like shrink wrap and independence words provided by one thomas
 jefferson where kinetic drum orchestras and ancient rain forest flutes and
 strings lent the music an otherworldly quality which further removed it from
 recordings by this heats angry peers radio prague features more electronic
 trickery and what sounds like someone actually tuning in and out of a czech
 radio broadcast theres a steady pitterpatter underneath and some rather dark
 drones in the background along with a haunting cello and though im tempted to
 say this could have influenced godspeed you black emperor its more likely an
 isolated vignette in a way the entire album seems removed from typical musical
 happenings even the underground maybe thats why its taken so long for
 this heat to start receiving their due
 
 the band got its digs in once more for a new kind of water expressing the rage
 that seems to have been implied throughout the record though rarely shown directly
 phrases like we were told to expect more and now that weve got more we want
 more we want more offer some of the only clear ideas about the feelings behind
 deceit and the music is appropriately insistent crashing drums wailing
 group vocals very precise discordant guitar lines over the years there have
 been bands to play as aggressively or even as strangely but very few have been
 able to rise from their collective influences and histories to create music so
 singularly distinctive and inspiring i dont know that hayward bullen and
 williams were trying to inspire and that they debated over whether to release
 their music at all could be evidence to support that they werent but the
 overall feeling i take away from this album is that of revolution and a very
 creative form of protest thats what i call punkthe title of amy annelles latest solo album a school of secret dangers
 quotes john steinbecks travels with charley steinbeck wrote the book
 after taking a trip across the country and annelles album has a similar feel
 collecting eleven songs from four years worth of home recordings it takes
 snapshots of american scenes with their spare tunes and elliptical lyrics
 annelles songs are like pinpricks on a vast map
 
 amy annelle has never sung a word she didnt need on her solo albums and in her
 work with the places she has a perfect sense of how to use silence in her
 recordings neither playing faster to fill the quiet nor slowing down to create
 it she recorded a school of secret dangers alone singing and accompanying
 herself on guitar her vocals are the selling point for the album annelle has a
 compelling voice that can sound both breathy and grounded dreamy and rough like
 having the bartender sing you a lullaby
 
 and the album sounds great considering annelle recorded it to lofi fourtrack
 the ambience is intimate but wideopen as if she were camping out in her backyard
 silence hangs behind every song and its a breathing presence on the quieter
 numbers for example around the low vocals on ugly stray the only context
 comes from the found sound between some of the tracks annelle also includes
 recordings of distorted music and talk programs from christian radio broadcasts
 cribbing from backwater religious radio may not be original but the dislocated
 voices are eerily effective
 
 compared to the indie pop of her last album the places excellent debut the
 autopilot knows you best these songs have simpler tunes and stick closer to
 country and folk the birds start talking english the upbeat opener lopes
 along as annelle sings about a campfire on a hillside other songs are more dour
 such as broke down about an abandoned cemetery the gently catchy melody of
 soft city carries a description of a city at night along with vague information
 about the person whos looking at it annelle challenges herself to make these
 lyrics ambiguous but not meaningless she generally succeeds but the more
 detailed songs have better lines check these ones from idaho we stay up
 all night listening to your grandpas 78s til the lights begin to glow and
 shadow all the lines on your face
a school of secret dangers requires more attention than the immediately
 likeable autopilot but its songs get better with every listen their
 subtlety when matched with the restraint of annelles performance allow her to
 explore ideas that she cant approach directly annelle implies the emptiness
 around the places she sings about and the movement of people through wide open
 spaces listening to halfreceived radio broadcasts and in doing so she captures
 the sound of being alonethe phrase intelligent hiphop gets thrown around a lot much like intelligent
 dance music and both bother me somewhat they seem to imply that hiphop and
 dance music are naturally unintelligent styles and a special provision has to be
 made to distinguish the select few exceptions that break the mold of stupidity
 and thats not even getting into the vaguely racist connotations the phrase brings
 with it you dont hear people talking about intelligent indie rock as a genre
 separate from plain ol indie rock
 
 i just wanted to wipe the slate clean before applying the phrase to mike ladd
 possibly the brainiest of the latest wave of ivy league rap theres a widely
 circulating story that ladd went to harvard he didnt he was just born in
 cambridge massachusetts but its revealing that the story is so widely accepted
 as gospel he sounds like he went there not that ladds rhymes possess some kind
 of mindtwisting complexity but everything he has his hand in radiates
 thoughtfulness and craft
 
 ladd discovered hiphop punk and poetry at roughly the same time as a kid so
 hes equally comfortable discussing or rapping about parliament j mascis and
 langston hughes he began his career as a spoken word artist in new york and his
 words still push the envelope conceptually but somewhere along the line he
 learned how to create amazingly textured and funky musical backdrops to accompany
 his words
 
 and actually theyre more than just backdrops on vernacular homocide on
 this sevensong ep containing half previously released bsides and half new
 tracks ladds instrumental sketches threaten to upstage his verbal throwdowns
 poseidons reigns for instance has ladd welding a raggedass drum machine to
 soaring fripplike guitar sear like something from bowies berlin trilogy then
 theres music for tanks sounding like the soundtrack to a tarkovsky scifi
 flick set in the caribbean both songs are clear highlights you take with you
 long after the words have faded from memory
 
 of the tracks which offer a taste of ladds lyrical skills the best of the batch
 is the opening track foxwoods a smoothly flowing antidote to the
 noflowfohoes brand of hiphop paybacks a bitch ladd sings even in
 small increments elsewhere the last word is a spacedout soul shoutout where
 ladd raves seemingly sarcastically nobody makes money like mike ladd makes
 money with operatic backup singers spurring him on northampton is a mad
 libstyle spedup rant that sounds like a fiveyearold singing james brown
 and it sits in sharp contrast to the final track a sober unaccompanied poem
 about ladds mother or more specifically about her age if i tell my mothers
 age ill never be forgiven ladd speaks slowly and deliberately st peter will
 look at me with those horrible cascading eyes like a woman from the ice storm
vernacular homocide is a quick and powerful dose of what makes mike ladd
 someone to keep an eye one great lyrics that never try to be witty they simply
 are and rarely reveal themselves immediately and an amazing stylistic
 breadth from semicomedic rap to what you could call singersongwriter hiphop
 his two fulllengths are also great but can be a bit overwhelming this disc
 might be a better place for the uninitiated to sample ladds lyrical prowess and
 sound manipulation wizardryit takes a lot of work to grow up in austin texas and manage to go through life
 with a livemusic deficiency but around late 98 i was one of the few diagnosed
 with this ailment although the condition is severe it can be easily remedied
 within a good 1416 months or one les savy fav show whichever comes first as
 the treatment which consists unsurprisingly of going to shows progressed i
 began donning a host of new traits and characteristics all symptomatic of my
 burgeoning addiction to the spectacle of live performance an insatiable mistress
 that will leave you penniless and in the gutter if not carefully restrained or
 so im told restraint however is something ive yet to exhibit
 
 you see when the polyphonic spree came through town opening for headlining
 heavyweights built to spill my pocketbook told me not to go actually my
 pocketbook and an invoice from wells fargo were both fighting to dissuade me from
 blowing my last 15 on such an obvious onenight stand but anyone will tell you
 that the call of doug martsch is not to be ignored even if he is touring in
 support of a mediocre album so with high spirits and a slightly altered dieting
 plan for the proceeding month i bought the ticket and took the ride
 
 having had no formal experience with the polyphonic spree i ignorantly deduced
 from the name that i was in for about an hour of freely traded rhymes about pop
 culture and sneakers the way the sugarhill gang used to drop it while 25 figures
 clad in nothing but unkempt white robes and cheshirecat smiles slowly lumbered
 onto the stage as my eyes discerned the familiar form of extripping daisy
 frontman tim delaughter my first inclination was to scale the fourfoot protective
 barricade that acted as the groups metallic moat and shake him vigorously in an
 effort to deprogram the fallen texas auteur but as i stood there waiting for a
 vat of koolaidflavored cyanide to make its appearance and confirm my deepest
 darkest fears i began to notice the song that was stirring to life on stage
 
 what ensued was a revivalist getdown that would put any episcopalian minister to
 shame delaughters warbling vocals unwavering heavenward gaze and beaming smile
 seemed to speak for the entire group which consists of two percussionists a
 choir and a theremin player amongst others in fact the evening could have
 easily found the polyphonic spree upstaging any number of lesser headliners were
 they not built to spill so then why does this the sprees first album released
 on delaughters own good records label seem so unimaginative
 
 as it stands the polyphonic spree are the musical approximation of saccharin in
 that they make a great substitute for pure unadulterated twee but also like
 saccharin they are possibly cancerous in heavy doses the more anthemic
 crowdpleasing numbers littered throughout the beginning stages of the
 polyphonic spree boast such endlessly repeated refrains as hey its the sun
 and it makes me shine which lose a lot of their appeal when taken out of their
 natural habitat the live setting and placed between your headphones in the end
 the experience becomes less like our generations takin care of business and
 more like those fireside singalongs you were coerced into participating in at
 summer camp
 
 the album comprised of 10 sections chronicles a group whose only precedents
 are the familiar melodies of lazy 1970s am radio and inspirational religious cable
 tv programming luckily though the group has an unrealized experimental side
 which can be attributed with some of the albums most exciting moments and one
 the discs best songs section 4 but for every risk taken theres a
 counterproductive indulgence a good example of this is section 3 which begins
 as a stunning meditation on guitar and viola before suddenly being overwhelmed by
 pan flutes and selfparodying chimes i mean it when i say that its the best
 ballad john stamos has done since he covered the beach boys forever
the beginning stages sadly never approaches anything greater than novelty
 given the fact that the polyphonic spree are a selfproclaimed choral symphonic
 pop band most songs come off like mid70s todd rundgren ouch with multitracked
 vocal harmonies the premise for the group is admittedly genius but if delaughters
 goal is to distill their stage presence and the giddiness conjured at spree
 performances onto compact disc he and his polyphonic friends will have to find
 a way to work around their musics seemingly necessary visual accompanimenthow raw do you like your dance music does modern techno feel like a soft blow to
 your skull there used to be a better way londons soul jazz records has released
 in the beginning there was rhythm a compilation of british postpunk bands
 including the slits gang of four throbbing gristle and cabaret voltaire were
 talking about drums and wires knifesharp scratchy rhythm guitar crappy synths
 and veteran funk and reggae horns were talking men shouting political slogans
 and naked women covered in mud and while this music sounds old it sure as hell
 isnt dated this stuff is primal made by people who were finding new ways to
 channel the brute instinct that first drove man to bang animal skins with sticks
 
 these songs came out of the bleak setting of industrial england in the late 70s
 and early 80s the thatcher administration came into power and skinheads and
 members of the national right roamed the streets against this climate bands
 emerged from the inner city melting pots embodying a new racial sexual and
 musical diversity djs spun reggae records at punk shows tape loops and
 synthesizers joined the guitar as lead instruments funk dub and experimental
 music were bigger influences than the velvet underground or iggy fucking pop
 to quote a certain ratios simon topping and allgirl and multiracial bands
 introduced new ideas to the white boys three chords and an attitude world of
 pop
 
 every track on this album cooks with the excitement of musicians trying new things
 for their coup single 23 skidoo were joined by a star funk bassist and horn
 section then once they had an unstoppable dance track they piled on sound
 effects of breaking glass and guns firing just because it sounds cool at the
 brainier end of the scale the shamefully obscure this heat manufactured 24 track
 loop with just a tape loop and a mixing board huddling in the studio that theyd
 made from a converted meat locker they crib from dub and the avantgarde but
 more important 24 track loop is a sick little number with a fast beat and a
 terrifically abrasive sound that comes off absolutely modern
 
 there are also straightup guitar bands which combined leftwing politics with
 assshaking rhythm sections the pop groups she is beyond good and evil one
 of their most infectious singles appears here with its bone marrow guitars and
 mark stewarts guttural swagger western values mean nothing to her reggae
 veteran dennis bovell who also produced albums for the slits adds effects that
 make it sound monstrously vast gang of four who played legendary tours in the
 states tear through to hell with poverty singing some are insane and theyre
 in charge over heavy drums and jagged searing guitars this single alone makes
 everything rage against the machine has ever aspired to redundant less aggressive
 and more offkilter the slits contribute the title song in the beginning there
 was rhythm ari ups untrained voice mutters needles and bellows the lyrics a
 little warbly and massively expressive shes in top form on this track
 
 you could almost call this compilation eclectic but thats too quaint a word
 for music that punches you in the gut the bands are diverse but every song has
 a killer beat that sells the political lyrics and grounds the experimentation
 whatever the methods and whoevers in the lineup every band here understands
 that fundamental deepasyoursoul rhythm like ari up sings god says you will
 dance
 
 if theres anythings wrong with the disc its that its too short the story of
 postpunk could take up several box sets the disc comes with 35 pages of liner
 notes but the record itself doesnt tell a story or connect the songs many
 bands got left out and it would also be interesting to hear how the bands
 developed for example to watch the early human league with its craptronic
 keyboards and allguy lineup grow into the band that created the synthpop
 masterpiece dare but the problem with big anthologies is that they
 inevitably use tracks that are important but arent fun in the beginning
 on the other hand doesnt have a single limp tune itll amaze new listeners
 and give old ones some hardtofind tracks buy itwhen it came to music poor little timmy could never do anything right they gave
 him a horn he blew in the wrong end they gave him a guitar he made feedback
 they sat him at a piano he opened it up and plucked at the chords so discouraged
 was little timmy by the taunts of his peers that one day he gave up playing music
 altogether then one sunny afternoon he stumbled upon a record by this guy
 named fog fog didnt necessarily play his instruments right either
 
 sure timmy had heard people scratching records but hed never heard anyone doing
 it like this it was strange almost haphazard in a way the music fell somewhere
 in between christian marclay and kid koala more a collage of strange sounds
 sometimes set to guitar or bass than the rhythmhappy scratchfests that comprise
 most traditional dj records fog seemed more interested in seeing how many strange
 sounds he could make with his turntables than in keeping a rhythm or showboating
 and yet there was something to the chaos that sounded totally planned completely
 sculpted timmy was amazed to hear someone show the same utter disregard for
 convention his very classmates had convinced him was so wrong
 
 fog became a catalyst for timmy he soon realized that there was no such thing as
 a right way to play an instrument and that there were others out there who
 believed this too soon he would discover other turntable wizards folks like
 christian marclay and otomo yoshihide and he grew even more awestruck a year
 later little timmy slightly less little and much less melancholy found himself
 surrounded by strange albums and had even taken up the turntable himself true
 fog wasnt quite so amazing now that hed heard all these other turntablists but
 it still had its moments and he certainly couldnt deny that it played the role of
 catalyst in his life or that it was in many ways responsible for his trajectory
 
 but enough about timmy lets talk about fog aka andrew broder a young minnesotan
 who grew up in fact only a few miles away from pitchforks esteemed editor but
 while schreiber was learning to pitch the fork broder was no doubt hiding away in
 a nearby suburban bedroom destroying records fooling around with turntables in
 the dark and following the call of his muse no matter how strange that call
 might have been
 
 as an avantgardist broders music is solid nothing revolutionary perhaps but
 solid where broder truly shines is in his understanding of pop and in the way
 he makes it fit so snugly with his more leftfield musings take the decidedly
 poppy pneumonia for example the track starts out sounding like another in a
 long line of neutral milk hotel imposters with distorted fuzz bass a simple
 acoustic guitar melody vocals that teeter dangerously on the edge that separates
 grating from sensitive and weird ghostly thereminlike noises hovering ominously
 in the background but rest assured its only broder and his turntable hes also
 keeping the beat with a looped gently scratched drum sample but its when the
 song reaches its instrumental interlude that broder really shines busting out a
 stunning turntable solo that sounds more like a harmonica or a guitar than a
 record player
 
 the technique hes using at this point is actually rather minimal using records
 with just one flat tone allowing it to play on its own more often than he
 manipulates it even then its just a quick scratch here and there and a pitch
 adjust before he allows it to play again still simple is not synonymous with
 ineffective or unoriginal the sound works indeed its broders willingness to
 give in to his pop sensibilities that make fog work so well
 
 truth and laughing gas opens as one of the more straightforward tracks on the
 album with thrashing guitar distorted bass ominous synths and frenzied hiphop
 scratching but as the song progresses the guitar falls away and the scratching
 grows more and more abstract eventually giving way to an exercise in ambience
 hitting a wall begins like ween or vintage beck replete with heavily treated
 wobbly vocals purposely sloppy guitar and wellplaced scratches but every so
 often broders turntable takes over as if possessed letting the song fall by
 the wayside as he presents a barrage of strange noises ultimately broder allows
 bits and pieces of crackly old folk records to fall into the collage and manipulates
 and contrasts them with feedbackladen guitar that brings us back to the songs
 opening broder restrains himself on glory layering violins and little bells
 underneath his manipulated percussion samples as clouddeads dose one weaves vocal
 digressions in and out nothing more than another element of the atmosphere
 
 if the poppy aspects of some of fogs songs end up alienating some stuckup
 bythebook avantgardists then so be it because its broders careful balancing
 act between the traditional and the abnormal that makes his music so interesting
 and if anything the albums more traditional moments will serve as a jumpon
 point for those whod never think to check out something like experimental
 turntablism its here that broder will succeed where many of his brethren fail
 not only is he creating innovative music hes making an effort to expand its
 audience as wellall right ill bite what does the pa stand for preppie anarchist pretentious
 asshole paranoid agoraphobic popular arboretum partially anesthetized
 physicians assistant
 
 wrong the pa only stands for pennsylvania a rather dull reason to put mysterious
 letters behind ones name not that pennsylvania is a dull state why without
 pennsylvania we wouldnt have rolling rock the phillies hands down the best
 logo font in sports and the constitution and even though pennsylvanias the
 only state in which ive ever received a speeding ticket i dont hold a grudge
 
 that may change however if i have to keep listening to matt pond pas the
 green fury the green fury ungood i dont like it boo
 
 the setup behind mppa is not innately flawed a melancholy singersongwriter
 fleshing out his songs with soaring orchestral arrangements some call it
 chamberpop and bands like the flaming lips or mercury rev pull it off to great
 effect matt pond pa on the other hand is a bit heavy on the chamber and way
 too light on the pop not to mention light on the dave fridmann but that cant
 be helped rather than adding depth and creativity the various strings horns
 keyboards and vibraphones are all seemingly used to disguise the tepid songs
 within an extravagantly wrapped christmas present with socks and underwear
 inside
 
 the blame therefore would have to fall squarely on bandleadersongwriter ponds
 slumped shoulders pond seems to have a knack for writing languid generic tracks
 that have all the pop of soggy rice krispies it all depends on your definition
 though if pop for you means instantly catchy hummable tunes you certainly
 wont find it here but if pop means boring versechorusverse song structure
 hey matt has you covered as for covering ill do my own with a blanket and
 this cd
 
 worst of all theres the morethanpassing resemblance ponds voice bears to
 mid90s frathouse poet adam duritz pond shares duritzs habit for introspective
 warbling with his vocals cracking ohsodramatically in the upper registers once
 you realize this similarity theres really no going back the unsurprising result
 is a textbook case of excessive emoting throw in ponds heavyhanded way with a
 lyric and im inclined to think him and duritz are the same person until proven
 otherwise
 
 without ponds tremulous yearning a handful of the songs measure 3 promise
 the bite might have been enjoyable in an aging indie rocker sitting on the
 porch with a glass of merlot and a david foster wallace novel sort of way still
 the many many string parts dont do anything on the green fury you havent
 heard a hundred times before even if they are wellexecuted from a technical
 standpoint other instruments arent so lucky though the french horn solo of
 jefferson will surely make pitchforks list of worst french horn solos ever
 coming soon and i think the last of my patience with the vibraphone was worn
 down by the records sixth track
 
 i suppose there are a few other nice things i can say about the green fury
 the album cover has a nice greenandyellow plaid pattern on it for instance
 that i wouldnt mind owning in couch or pants form ill award the band bonus
 points for cleverly releasing a preview ep last year called this is not the
 green fury and someday i may likely use matt pond pa as proof in an argument
 over whether independent music is inherently better than major label releases but
 other than that matt pond pa is just an easy target for wiseass negative blurbs
 what do you like better no mr pond i expect you to die or this pond
 could use a good descummingprincess superstar is not as many junketjittery journalists would have you believe
 the female marshall mathers her tongue is far more whiplash and in terms of
 panache she got detroits trailer park provocateur beaten by a mile plus shes
 the mistress of her own destiny not another dre pawn her previous releases came
 out bearing the manufacturing stamps of her own stridently anticorporate a big rich
 major label and corrupt conglomerate outfits
princess superstar is is the followup to 2000s last of the great
 twentiethcentury composers and her transition from selfreleasing material
 to signing with k7s hiphop offshoot rapster will ensure her broader distribution
 which means that all of us who arent prowling manhattans east village for white
 labels will have the pleasure of the princess company
 
 this album is as youd expect from such a title is collection of beatdown
 statements about who princess superstar is shes as rapidly keen to distance
 herself from the idea that shes some producers dolly as she would be to distance
 herself from someone with scabies so who writes your lyrics is an assault
 weapon rhyme son of sam im the daughter of sam slaughter a man on the
 microphone pardon me maam was that part of a man or your son i just whipped
 on the mic and sent home princess reinforces those homicidal statements with
 more operational ones so im a girl yeah im white and i write all night with
 a bare swingin light on the computer alright a producer alright i produced
 this song so you know who you are you know you were wrong no i was not in that
 porn on golden blonde got it goin on more james bond than sean john
 
 not only is princess superstar all about eliminating any mispreconceptions about
 her being a white chick in hiphop but shes also gagging to emasculate the style
 too in keith n me her duet with the spankmaster himself superstar leaves
 kool keith panting and blueballed in a starstruck moment she mutters i gotta
 call my moms tell her keiths on my song ultramagnetic you helped my headache
 like a music paramedic you mad athletic there i said it then she regains her
 brash senses and returns to her rhyming samantha jones self reducing keiths dick
 to softserve
 
 on bad babysitter superstar satirizes what people think of her playing the
 craven teenager to the hilt
 
 babysitting sucks but whatever
 they got junk food kung fu egg fu dig dug a dog too
 and a hot jew mr weintraub i mean hes old but not dimed out
 if im bad ill turn around in the corner for time out
 aiight josh what you wanna do you wanna watch cartoonsplatoon hey get back in the room
 i assume your folks are gonna be out late go make me kool aid
 im a sit on the couch and masturbate
 then call my boyfriend gabe and see if he ate
 spit out my bubbalicious and get to one of them
 big fridges that could fit 10 midgets
 damn theyre rich hey she left me fifty dishes
 bitch
 
 with we got panache princess superstar outlines her materialistic goals before
 stating that no matter what shes going to party
 
 its ironic how erotic my robotic sonnets
 get girls in bonnets hot like harry connicks
 sick on gin and tonics we super sonic hook you on our phonics
 learned ebonics by erotic ebony dick and mantronix
 never stoppin it sock electronic shit allotted
 the whole club up when we spotted it
 and if we wanted it fill it with men and spawn and shit
 aint nothing wrong with it
 lets get the party started shit lets get it on and hit
 
 as a hedonists manifesto this has decidedly more fifth avenue elan than andrew
 wks preliterate cavedweller grunts
 
 though the album showcases lyrical dexterity and directness the beats that frame
 them are less finessed perhaps the princess desire to be perceived as a unique
 talent has led her to resist mimicking flavorofthemonth production for a more
 generic postnative tongues sound though its too much to ask that she team up
 with any of mille plateauxs clickhop artists id love to hear this album
 produced by vladislav delay or kid 606 on the evidence of his reworkings of
 missy elliott that album would be truly amazing
 
 having worked for seven or so years in the manhattan hiphop community princess
 superstar is not out to amaze she wants to get paid and she deserves to but
 shes going to be in a precarious position if shes going to become more than a
 nominal superstar as well as avoiding becoming a peripheral loudmouth skeeze for
 some aspiring rocafella she needs to avoid settling for dueting with gwen
 stefani when she should be guesting with le tigre the princess has without
 question the talent the wit and the sass to live up to her alias this record
 is certainly not the masterpiece i believe shes capable of but rather a clear
 premonition of such an albumnight owls 01 is the best kind of label compilation one with an overriding
 theme rather than slapping together a bunch of castoffs haphazardly deluxes
 mike martinez commissioned tracks some by deluxe artists some not that relate
 in some way to the nocturnal in addition to reflecting the nighttime premise
 most of the artists here approach electronic music from the glitchclickcut
 angle lending further textural continuity to the compilation
 
 that said one mans continuity is anothers redundancy and theres no doubting
 that if youre growing tired of glitches you will not enjoy night owls 01
 this sort of sound is everywhere in electronic music these days and a few of these
 tracks seem nothing more than indistinct idm with a few fashionable signifiers
 to ignore the compilation as a whole because of a handful of dull tracks would
 be a mistake though because theres some exceptional work happening here and
 despite the similarities in approach and sound its not hard to tell where the
 real talent lies on night owls 01
 
 for starters you have to look to label boss mike martinez he contributes two
 tracks one in collaboration with visual artists and designer jon santos whom
 he works with as partsplaces the other under his familiar electric birds guise
 the partsplaces track untitled no 8 is a standout a brilliant sheen of
 subaquatic drone and throbbing feedback sprinkled gently with evocative clicks
 and glitches it actually sounds more like electric birds than the electric birds
 track autofibre in which assorted belllike tones are processed and split apart
 before the tune develops into a quivering mediation on two organ chords complete
 with relaxed drum programming
 
 also skilled is finnish newcomer esa ruoho whose two exceptional tracks mark him
 as a producer to watch the bass bubbles of molies 1 feel dark and cold with a
 highend rolloff conjuring the arctic breeze alec empire cultivated on his low
 on ice release more impressive still is molies 2 which feels like midnight
 in the oilsoaked field behind the abandoned screw machine shop the sounds of
 strange chattering creatures are mixed with a hum that seems sampled from a slowly
 creaking weathervane helping make the track genuinely scary
 
 deluxe artist eblake contributes the similar and equally strong nachtmusik a
 track that would have been the best cut his debut record clanking metal vague
 splashing sounds and deep organ chords give the piece the feel of a three am
 film noir scene the final highlight is by littleknown french producer aspic a
 feast of microstoriastyle botched transmissions the sound of an amplified tap
 on a massive phone network fed through a delay machine
 
 the above is the good stuff and the remainder of night owls 01 is not so
 much bad as indistinct the tracks in between the standouts do little to draw
 attention to themselves and instead seem to serve as lengthy bridges between
 the peaks overall night owls 01 makes for a good fronttoback listen
 and effective background music just be sure to pull yourself from your book at
 the first sound of something exceptionalwith all the love we here at pitchfork have showered on the microphones lately we
 thought it high time to let mirah in on some action too you see besides
 appearing on just about every microphones release so far mirah full name mirah
 yom tov zeitlyn released an excellent collection of songs in 2000 called you
 think its like this but really its like this which was produced by lead
 microphone phil elvrum and shes issued enough singles and comp tracks over the
 past couple of years to choke all of calvin johnsons kittens
 now gearing up for her sophomore fulllength mirah drops a nice little ep on us
 called cold cold water when i first heard the title the sick part of me
 was hoping for a cover version of the old country standard popularized by classic
 cowboy balladeer marty robbins such was not the case but the title track does
 evoke robbins in a strange way its a bombastic gunfighter ballad of sorts
 coming off not entirely unlike bjrk on peyote having visions of the old west
 and youd think it was all completely tongueincheek judging from the cover art
 which depicts mirah as a masked outlaw ready to fire her handgun at who knows
 what evil offcover menace yet taken on its own the song is deadly serious
 dark and full of the kind of notso vague sexual innuendos weve come to expect
 from mirah it starts with the lines i saddled up my pony right and rode into
 the ghostly night it was wide wide open accompanied by a simple guitar strum
 then phil elvrums panoramic morriconeesque production technique explodes onto
 the soundstage with swelling strings huge crashing cymbals mammoth tympani and
 strikingly effective hoofclopping sounds meanwhile mirah sings about as far
 as i can tell finding a lover and taking him away to where the waters deep to
 make the air you breath so sweet it gets kinda vague from there but its the
 discrepancy between mirahs voice which is intimacy incarnate and the sweeping
 grandeur of the production and backing music that makes the song truly affecting
 the dynamic creates a complex but beautiful irony thats intoxicating
 after the title track there are three songs of admirable bedroom folk played
 solo and recorded by calvin johnson including a unadorned version of cold cold
 water then theres eight tracks of excerpts snippets from the elvrumenhanced
 title track singled out first the string section is heard all by itself then
 guitar and background vocals then drums and percussion and so on and its
 amazing how a close listen to these snippets alter how you listen to cold cold
 water you hear all these little parts you missed the first time around it
 turns the ep into more of a participatory experience and its an interesting
 way to fill up an ep without resorting to bmaterial keeping focus on the main
 song and enhancing the experience of listening to it
 im not giving elvrum all the credit here the songs are what hold the ep
 together but this kid is a genius when it comes to recorded sound and
 judging from the sound of the eps title track hes put a lot more time and
 effort into the recording process of mirahs forthcoming album advisory
 committee than he did for you think its like this with any luck
 it will be mirahs first exceptional releasewhat is it about depravity that demands attention from disaster porn to lifetime
 movies our culture loves to vicariously exorcise their diminutive traumas through
 those whose lives have been wrought with pain this carries over to the world of
 music where the dynamic between tragedy and reverence is exalted rather than
 critiqued and personified by such talents as nick drake tim buckley johnny ace
 and more recently mark sandman the macabre tales and images of their
 selfdestruction are indelibly linked to the bodies of work they left behind
 forever blurring the lines that separate an impartial assessment of their talents
 from the content of their character
 
 the truth is that the music of those who burn
 out isnt necessarily judged by a different set of standards so much as its
 judged by the standards the artists set for themselves during their creative
 zeniths after all these modern legends posthumously govern a world where rumors
 and hearsay reach mythical proportions and idolaters devote their entire lives to
 collecting every shred of sound their own personal godgoddess ever committed to
 tape
 
 syd roger barrett is one of those golden calves though fashioned by a much
 different maker the infamous story of his rise to the forefront of the burgeoning
 british psychedelic scene in the late 60s for those of you not up on your syd
 he was the premier singersongwriter of pink floyd that fell into a druginduced
 mania catalyzed by alreadyprevalent schizophrenic conditions has been reiterated
 exaggerated invoked and novelized so many times that its arguably overshadowed
 his seminal contributions to popular music these contributions his two solo
 albums the madcap laughs and barrett both released in 1970
 transcend his work with late60s pink floyd and make for haunting aural documents
 of a prolific talents dilapidating psyche while paradoxically managing to retain
 a rich charm and hooks sharp enough to make peter pan wet his tights
 
 discounting a few independently distributed releases and cleopatras octopus
 no serious attempt has ever been made to compile the best of syd barrett let
 alone to confine the content to his solo material this may be partially due to
 the herculean nature of the task though the madcaps output as a solo artist
 only adds up to roughly 45 songs 22 of which are contained here it would be
 easy for the compiler to fail in their intention given syds penchant for an
 enduring arrangement and melody
 
 the release of capitols wouldnt you miss me which draws from every facet
 of barretts available recorded output is certainly no exception notably omitting
 no mans land a common fan favorite and the stark acoustic demo of rats
 which is home to some of barretts most selfeffacing and successful
 streamofconsciousness and was originally released with fuller instrumentation
 on barrett before finding its way onto opel a collection of rarities
 and outtakes regardless the collection itself is a long overdue acknowledgment
 of the disarming beauty found in syds work outside the psychedelic stratumoperating under the assumption that all freestyle is essentially the same i will
 draw all analogies to freestyle fellowships new album temptations from
 another sort of freestyle canine freestyle
canine freestyle is choreographed dog performance with music illustrating the
 training and joyful relationship of a dog and handler team canine freestyle
 expands the sport of obedience by broadening the scope of dog training adding an
 artistic element through the inclusion of music and dance the reach drive and
 beauty of an athletic trained dog moving to music can take ones breath away
 canine freestyle federation
 
 whew let me catch my breath i was just watching some dog freestyle although
 you might imagine that dog freestyle aka the best idea ever would bear only a
 semantic resemblance to the freestyle fellowship you would be gravely wrong the
 similarities are actually quite striking allow me to elaborate
without sharing would this have happened no it would not have happened
 from the article canine freestyle a point of view by joan tenille
 
 los angelesbased hiphop legends the freestyle fellowship share four ways
 between the capable flow of mcs mikah 9 self jupiter aceyalone and peace
 none of them sound simply like roleplayers each has skills enough to carry an
 album and each one of them has and yet for one reason or another they
 continue to step out of their personal spotlights to contribute to this posse
 its worked well in the past
your dog will quickly learn to recognize his music for his freestyle youll
 see a new sparkle in his eye feet stepping higher and a tail wagging harder a
 new star is born from the article getting started with canine freestyle
 by alison jaskiewicz
 
 the freestyle fellowship caught on to the game quickly before even signing to a
 label the fellowship owned the la underground scene with bootlegged copies of
 their 1991 deeperthanunderground debut to whom it may concern they
 followed it up with an acknowledged underground masterpiece inner city griots
 in 1993 griots displayed the ample mc skills of the posse boisterous
 urgent energetic and playful a new star was born
 
 in the eight years hence however it looks like the acclaims gone to their
 collective heads as i see it the rhyming confidence spectrum rcs begins at
 cocky and runs all the way to delusions of godhood in other words all mcs
 start out cocky and cocky is good you want a cocky mc then with acclaim
 some get fatter in the cranium believing themselves enlightened see common
 qtip and in the most severe cases become convinced of their own divinity
 see rakim jay z unfortunately delusions of godhood when not actually
 accompanied by lyrical godhood merely spell complacency with no chip on his
 shoulder the mc thinks hes so good that he no longer even bothers to prove it
 
 and on temptations the ego trip is intolerable one especially contrived
 example comes with fragrance a poetry number based on random vibraphones and
 guest rapper abstract rude going overboard with nonsense cliches like scattered
 thoughts of our battered love to its bloody pulp fiction was tarantinoesque
 ghetto juliette on other tracks the guys simply sound older and more complacent
 unlike on inner city griots when their youthful exuberance might have even
 been construed as showing off but when an mc has the flow of aceyalone or mikah
 9 you want him to show off these moments are too rare on temptations
do i have to dance no emphatically no but yes you may from the
 article canine freestyle do i have to dance by alison jaskiewicz
 
 do i have to dance to this album no emphatically no but yes i suppose dancing
 to temptations is possible maybe even with your bitch if your dog is a
 girl the beats on temptations truly sound like freestyle beats as if
 producer josef leimberg had them preloaded on his keyboard since 1993 just
 in case the fellowship ever decided to show up to the studio i mean inner
 city griotss background was never considered especially fresh but there was
 charm in those basic beats they always seemed so practical never trying to
 impress or steal the show from the main attraction on temptations the
 shit comes off like the street preset blaring from some imitation casio keyboard
 in the back of a pamida storeroom check the discount aceyalone cut different
just as in evaluating a dog for conformation where you must consider the whole
 dog not just the parts so when evaluating freestyle movement overanalysis of
 parts feet tail head body results in loss of the whole picture you can
 analyze a mozart piano concerto note by note and still not fathom the genius of
 the whole piece the whole is greater than the sum of the parts from the
 article music rhythm and freestyle by alison jaskiewicz
 
 ms jaskiewicz has a good point while ill avoid any mozart references i do
 appreciate the general structure of her analogy the fellowship has always been
 about the rhymes thus the freestyle association the whole story is that
 aceyalone mikah 9 peace and saturn still have flow sure that flow has
 changed with age but its still confident and sortof interesting the first few
 tracks notably no hooks no chorus and the title track sound mature but remain
 fierce overall though the frenetic spirit displayed on their first two discs
 has regressed a little backing up from inspiring to decent and for all its
 flaws it really isnt a bad disc just a disappointing oneand just as the early days of man were still dripping from primordial dew the
 early form of a band can often be underdeveloped consider all the factors
 theres the concept because who doesnt have an angle these days theres
 the image what are they going to stand for and whos supposed to think theyre
 cool theres the labor how will the band get heard and get its rather angular
 imaginary message across theres the people what combination of personality
 disorders will help them achieve all they desire and lastly theres the music
 what mixture of influences and accidents are they going to hide when their record
 gets played hopefully its a wonder bands ever happen at all
 
 the notion of personalities and their various disorders should never be
 underestimated as the band gathers form and direction i imagine that one or two
 dominant forces will be the impetus for starting the group and may preside as
 reining catalysts for the major decisions at first see above over time the
 other members will either go along with the plan or assert their visions into
 the group dynamic sometimes that means things fall apart but if not
 interesting reactions can happen or not it almost seems a stroke of luck
 with no more predetermination than a coin toss whether the band exists for very
 long
 
 ive written about a few japanese bands for pitchfork and as you may or may
 not know several of the players are known to move in and out of other bands
 and projects when i look back on it many of these projects seem more like
 onetime affairs or just chance encounters that happened to be recorded a
 few of the projects are longterm but even many of those feature people who
 are known better for playing other music or with other people ive always
 wondered how the same pool of talent keeps mixing and remixing with itself to
 produce so much interesting sound of course the musicians are quite good and
 experienced and such but i was taught in rock journalism 201 probably christgaus
 section the old hag that talent doesnt guarantee anything except raised
 expectations for the listener
 
 kikuchi naruyoshi used to play with a very nice band called tipographica they
 were never a big club act but maintained a fairly widespread following for fans
 of avantgarde rock and free jazz making something of a zappa noise though in
 that infamously hectic japanese style unfortunately they broke up personality
 issues money ran out of impossibly complicated heads and went their own
 ways naruyoshi started playing free improv and spacy fusion with his tokyo
 zawinul bach duo maybe because after so many years in a large ensemble tipo was
 six strong two guys seemed an easier task to manage but that cant be right
 because he then formed a huge band with a huge name called date course pentagon
 royal garden
 
 this band has 1012 people at any given moment of which otomo yoshihide is
 probably the most well known in the west though other eminent figures are
 involved as well they also bring a touch of fusion to the mix but as often
 will play 20minute noisetrance perhaps similar to rovo with whom they
 released a split cd or even tortoise if they upped the noise quotient a bit
 this is all well and good but given the fact so many people are involved and
 perhaps due to naruyoshis relatively quick change in direction their most recent
 release seems a tad underdeveloped
report from iron mountain named after a confidential us government war report
 from the early 60s as well as a prominent japanese livehouse where the band
 has appeared features about half lengthy experimental tunes and half straight
 ahead funkfusion okay whats so special about that catch 22 starts things
 off in a very cool way by playing trance from an unbalanced point of view
 multiple drummers play in seemingly multiple meters and tempos while a fender
 rhodes figure repeats and synth noise tears apart any unnecessary tonality a
 lady says im something special a few times though its not as if anyone has
 to convince me on the merits of turning workaday postrock into an anarchic
 symphonette about midway through things take a change for the violent as the
 tempo increases threefold and the bass degenerates into a twonote pattern all
 the while supporting a very fiery guitar solo it seems as if naruyoshis
 tendency to jazz things up has been overtaken by the group noise
 
 play mate at hanoi is much more lowkey almost like something return to forever
 would have done during one of chick coreas less dramatic moments a very 70s
 analog synthline plays a fluid lead while the bass and restrained upbeat
 percussion accompanies an organ jumps out of the right speaker similar to some
 of the playing on the early miles davis fusion records wherein the organ acted
 more as a confrontational coloring element than actual comping instrument this
 leads to a nice soprano sax solo and the tune is well within the domain of
 standard fusion a pretty abrupt change from the first tune but thats not
 really strange in itself
 
 that is until s this begins with a very loungey funk figure on guitar
 surely not yoshihide though he is one of the credited guitar players and
 some rollerrink organ the band enters with congas and something of a sambarock
 beat i step back and to my horror realize the band is playing cocktail music
 like you hear on cruises and commercials for said cruises another soprano solo
 ensues and is so smooth i wonder if this is even the same band that played the
 first song and it lasts for almost eleven minutes like that later the band
 pulls a similar trick on their cover of hey joe playing very standard and
 often corny funkrock for about ten minutes before i come to the realization
 theyre not going anywhere ironic with this were talking music with the edge
 of a mouthwash ad
 
 there is a bit of redemption in circlelinehard core peace where they play
 more fusion licks but bring in a touch of polyrhythmic groove and a tad more
 excitement to the barrage of soprano solos however im still left with the
 sting of unfulfilled promise from the first tune and wondering if these guys
 should ever have made this record maybe it sounds better live or perhaps that
 everything was recorded at different dates and in three different studios
 signifies that the concept for how the band should sound changed from time to
 time im a huge fan of juxtaposing genres and concepts and certainly like to
 see all my favorite players get together but report from iron mountain
 seems to me like what happens when group dynamic and development is overwhelmed
 by lack of focus as a result underwhelmingahhh the girls locker room the paradise of every teenage boys imagination details filled in by
 dozens of late 70searly 80s hardr comedies from days when gratuitous nudity was still a treasured
 cinematic tradition oh the sexy sexy things happening in every girls locker room just beyond the
 furrowed brow of a pubescent male population trying to develop xray vision only the slumber party
 pillow fight can compete with the girls locker room showers in evoking imagery thats given rise to a
 thousand sticky nights
 
 if im starting to creep you out a bit and to tell the truth im starting to creep myself out
 its a reasonable approximation of what i think pele was going for in claiming that enemies
 was recorded in yep a girls locker room combined with the unfortunately detailed pencil
 drawing of the drummer sans garments on his lower half yes there is wang the whole package has
 a certain sex offender tint to it
 
 surely this ploy is intended to counteract the relatively antiseptic nature of the bands chosen
 genre instrumental mathrock whose bands are constantly striving tendons taut foreheads dotted
 with sweat to avoid being considered mere background music perhaps they thought a dose of sinisterness
 would give listeners something they could get a firm grip on but for all the pentup fantasies that fueled
 this record enemies doesnt rise to the occasion
 
 pele are at their best when their compositions feel like progressions rather than a lot of
 coolsounding parts somewhat arbitrarily soldered together safe dolphin has a few dashes of jarring
 synth thrown in to keep things slightly offbalance and hospital sports holds its own with mean
 acousticelectric guitar interplay these tracks evolve with admirable patience and a spontaneous
 feel if only mathrock fans knew how close some of this material is to that of more accomplished
 jam bands they wouldnt be wearing their hornrims so high
 
 pele are attempting to fight the rut theyve start to mine with the addition of a fourth member
 suspiciously credited as playing computer tambourines just like wilco unfortunately the software isnt for
 any of them loops or glitches the kids like these days but rather for determined attempts at texture
 read incongruous buzzing and cutup radio transmissions inserted all over crisis win and
 mysterious noises that had my orangealertskittish heart looking for exploding ordinances on my walk
 to the subway
 
 the original trio tries to keep pace with this new texture most of which is similar to the majority of
 processdriven laptopjiggering safe dolphin is almost done in a couple times by quiet
 sections where the percussion sounds like somebody kicking a trash bag around while sepit uses
 similar junkyard effects to annoying result transitions like hooves an unfortunate misstep into a
 pile of new age and technical workouts like cooking light where too many people
 solo at once dont help matters
 
 yet enemies is a complaisant album enjoyable but not to the point of sticking long in ones
 memory the biggest criticism i could level against pele could apply to the whole mathrock genre
 with out huds street dad still fresh in the underground hive mind enemies
 feels like an unnecessary step back to the days when indie instrumentals werent so excitingly
 infected with the disco virus despite the palpable horniness its recording environment inspires
 enemies is like so much of its brethren an entirely unsexy affair and thus a rather sterile
 listenive begun to wonder if angie aparo and pj olsson distribute their work directly
 to bargain bins kind of like gary busey does with the video store for whatever
 reason it seems that every used cd store nationwide including stores in virginia
 michigan and new york has multiple copies of aparos the american and
 olssons words for living joining of course multiple copies of the verve
 pipes villains and a smattering of kings x i havent heard much from
 either artist but the impression the bin gives me is that neither is very good
 
 after a recent evening of cd shopping i could have easily concluded that the fruit
 bats blow out of six manhattan secondhand merchants four had copies of
 echolocation and although the disc had yet to find the bargain bin in any
 of them it seemed their ultimate destiny the reason i kept an open mind is that
 i had seen the group in concert opening for the shins and modest mouse in
 late september the show wasnt that great but it was certainly tolerable and
 you could tell that vocalistsongwriter eric johnson enjoyed himself on stage and
 took his job seriously its hard to not at least appreciate a guy who loves what
 hes doing
 
 as the live show was tolerable so is echolocation but not much more the
 fruit bats seem obsessed with one sound one that i would describe as folkcountry
 indiepop for lack of a more appropriate subsubsubgenre label in short lots
 of acoustic guitar and lazy slowrolling sentimental compositions peppered with
 banjo ukulele piano and pleasant vocal harmonies clearly summertime music
 
 unfortunately though what you hear on the albums first track the old black
 hole is pretty much what you hear on tracks 212 every song moves at the same
 country tempo with the similar sounding folksy accoutrements and almostconvincing
 sentimentality when i forgot i was listening it was pleasant when i tuned in
 more closely i was left impatient crying out to the fruit bats go somewhere
 already in this way it may have been better if the fruit bats were fronted by
 the other eric johnson of cliffs of dover fame and friend to fellow g3
 guitar summit participants steve vai and joe satch satriani that would have
 blown my ass off then again i probably wouldnt have been able to hear much
 ukulele over johnsons overdriven polyrhythms and unusual dorian modes
 
 other than infrequent exclamations resulting from my boredom see above
 echolocation sparked very little reaction from me either positive or
 negative chances are i wont listen to it much chances are better that ill
 be visiting one of those two stores that didnt have a copyjohn zorns tzadik label works with some of the best improvisers in the world but
 it often focuses on their work as composers musicians who routinely play a whole
 set without a written note can turn around and make albums where their writing
 dictates the flow of performance working in a mix of improv and composition that
 aims to be more refined and maybe more highbrow than free jazz susie ibarra
 the star drummer who has collaborated on highintensity jazz gigs with david s
 ware and william parker as well touring with yo la tengo and adding percussive
 effects to their and then nothing turned itself insideout has recorded
 two albums on tzadik that showcase her spacious writing her second and most
 recent album songbird suite uses an allstar trio plus guest ikue mori
 to perform a set of austere and beautiful pieces
 
 ibarra kicks off the album by taking the trio out for a spin shes joined by
 craig taborn on piano keyboards and electronics and jennifer choi on violin
 on the straightforward azul taborn and chois solos demonstrate their unique
 approaches taborn who made his name with james carter and has stolen the show
 in several avantjazz combos demonstrates why hes one of the most inventive and
 fun pianists out there his solo is rigorous but joyful busy but methodical it
 churns with enthusiastic clusters of sound choi a classically trained violinist
 is aggressively virtuosic she swoops around the melody like a canary tied to a
 firecracker working an array of sounds from her instrument ibarra doesnt
 showcase her own playing until her drum feature trance 1 her performance is
 reflective and full of silence with asiansounding percussion complementing her
 drumkit
 
 these players are as attentive to sound and texture as to the notes and ibarras
 compositions give them a variety of frameworks the title track the albums
 centerpiece lets the trio explores open space taborn begins with quiet
 sonarlike electronics and choi and ibarra ease in with stark splashes of color
 taborn has rarely played piano and electronics on the same album let alone on the
 same song as he does for flower after flower this album is a great example of
 how expansive his palette has become chois statements and ibarras interjections
 complement taborn to make a complete sound world so complete that when they
 include an actual birdsong recording on the track the effect is clumsily literal
 
 its an equal trio on the slow numbers but on the busier tunes taborn and ibarra
 become a steadier rhythm section behind chois violin nocturne starts with
 another soaring fiery violin solo propelled by taborn and ibarra the squeaking
 extremes of her high register give way to an eerie distant sound in the quiet
 section and then a jittery conclusion where each player creates arch precise
 lines
 
 ikue mori a tzadik regular and a leading improviser on laptop computer plays on
 three tracks an improvised duet with ibarra and two group pieces moris
 burbling percussive samples add to the slow burn of flower after flower and
 trance 3 her sound is busier and slightly less compelling than the other
 three musicians but she adds an interesting commentary and her duet with ibarra
 trance 2 is a short fascinating soundscape of otherworldly percussion sounds
 
 with this concise album just fortyfive minutes for nine tunes the trio
 thoroughly explores ibarras writing songbird suite exemplifies what
 tzadiks composerfocused imprints aim for an album of new music that shows the
 best collaboration between an openminded composer and sympathetic improvisersused to be that id define the music i bought and enjoyed by genres i liked rock
 music and jazz i didnt like hiphop or country but after i started working
 and was able to buy more music i found my tastes had developed i no longer
 limited my purchases to certain genres and as a result i began to discover
 musicians of all stripes i enjoyed but not everyones musical taste grows up
 along with them many continue to depend on genres rather than sound to decide
 what theyll try many continue to make brash allencompassing statements like
 i dont like dance music or i dont like classical music well into their
 middleages and beyond
 consider electric ladyland clickhop version 10 an attempted public
 service from mille plateaux yes the same oftenrevolutionary mille plateaux label
 that also brought us the clicks and cuts series following in the footsteps
 of prefuse 73s scott herren machine drum and other likeminded acts the artists
 assembled on this twodisc collection dedicate themselves to furthering the recent
 trend that sees the shrinking of the gap between hiphop dance and electronic
 music the results are as varied as are the approaches
 on the sparse m 06 short alvanoto sculpts quiet beats out of static safety
 scissors contributes an eminently danceable soundscape of choppedup samples with
 mr blister is connected to my fingers and theres spectres minimalist
 instrumental infrared danse of the dead part 2 which gets more mileage out
 of three or four samples chopped up and pitchshifted naturally and a simple
 beat than many artists get out of a full record library
 that benchmark of hiphopelectronic amalgamations the nowtrademarked prefuse
 73style choppedup vocal manipulations shows up a few times here most
 effectively on andreas tillianders spastic hastjobb and agfdlays opener
 the return of us its an interestingsounding technique and its popularity
 is justified but listening to the lyrics on electric ladylands other
 vocal tracks one begins to wonder if there isnt another reason why garbled
 vocals seem to appear almost as often as the real thing these days
 with the
 exception of dleks rhymes about revolution and fellowship on kid606s remix
 of r u in it at least those parts not totally obscured by spastic strokes
 of noise the vocals on electric ladyland rarely merit much notice at
 best we get selfaggrandizing wordplay from antipop consortiums high priest
 at worst graphit e ponders the location of his niggas all around theres an
 unfortunate feeling that someone somewhere decided that lyrical content doesnt
 matter so long as the music behind the words is unique an unfortunate decision
 that keeps electric ladyland from achieving all it might have
 also disappointing by no fault of the artists i lay the blame on the comps
 producer are contributions by captain comatose and german house stars mri which
 make extensive use of the same female vocal track while this could have been an
 interesting experiment theres little with which to differentiate the two tracks
 especially considering that both accompany the singers pontifications with a
 driving bassline bleeps and little flourishes circling a beat
 still there are a lot of solid tracks here frank bretschneiders holt is a
 simple yet effective downtempo number built around a handful of resonating
 electronically produced tones and crackling percussion auchs all that pretty
 horses starts off heading in the same direction but takes a wrong turn somewhere
 along the line into a minefield of commonplace glitchery
 towering above all the rest though is akufens contribution a track called
 little hop of horror that begins with the cacophonous static and random noise
 of a manipulated radio tuning knob before finally tuning in on a laidback
 guitarbased funk groove as the song plays out akufen makes unpredictable loops
 out of the bits of static and random radio sounds while many of the tracks here
 entertain this is one of the few that truly succeeds in merging elements of
 experimental dance and hiphop
 ultimately the biggest problem with electric ladyland is that in its
 admittedly noble attempt to disregard genre lines it tends to come up short where
 cohesiveness is concerned though its goal is without a doubt to open the minds
 of listeners to other musical possibilities i cant help but feel that some of
 the straightforward 44 time dance tracks like sophie andersons dont follow
 will grate on those listeners who get a kick out of more experimental fare like
 hastjobb and vice versa more tracks like akufens would have made for a more
 compelling compilation one with a stronger unifying theme instead electric
 ladyland is just a collection of solid songs this is hardly a bad thing but
 if compilations are to be held to the same standards as straightup albums then
 its impossible to deny that this one seems a bit lost at times
 in many ways hiphop dance and electronic music have grown up next door to one
 another each existed for ages as a vague idea rather than as an actual genre or
 style all three came into their own in the 80s and all gained mainstream
 appreciation in the 90s today we often see hiphop dance and electronic music
 pandering to the masses cheap bastardizations of brilliant work masquerading as
 the real thing so its reassuring to know that there are artists just as there
 have been since the early 20th century toiling away in relative obscurity
 ensuring that both genres continue to develop maybe one day thanks to their
 work no one will miss out on great music due to some prejudicial predetermined
 notion of genre in the meantime the enlightened among us can enjoy electric
 ladyland clickhop version 10i would be there say the word im a straight shooter like larry bird
 this is an actual line from one of the songs on vermonts calling albany
 actually its not just one line its the chorus i just wanted to get it out
 there in the open for all to see and get it away from its buffering support
 system all the other lame justbarely passable lyrics on the album so it can
 be publicly humiliated who actually sits down and puts words like these on paper
 scratches their chin and says yeah
 davey von bohlen and dan didier from the promise ring and chris rosenau from pele
 thats who this is the trios second album and after forcing myself through it
 a few times heres hoping vermonts members start spending a lot more time at
 their day jobs right quick not that i was ever much of a fan of the promise ring
 or pele but considering that this sounds nothing like either of them i dont
 think its a issue
 judging from the clichridden lyrics showcased here i can understand why so much
 promise ring material i remember hearing was so terse or maybe the bad lyrics
 were always there buried under the sugarsweet pop banality regardless this is
 not the case with vermont the sparse often acoustic musical backdrop pushes the
 lyrics to the fore and to put it plainly they dont hold up well under the
 increased scrutiny the melodramatic posturing and selfpity that was kept more
 in check in the promise ring is given free reign with vermont and nearly every
 song title is a heavyhanded attempt at a pun or some other halfassed witticism
 which makes the ultraserious vocal delivery and stark instrumentation even more
 annoying
 besides the above quoted nadir there are a few other noteworthy low points on
 calling albany to start from the bottom theres a near cover of the
 commodores three times a lady nestled within a song called commodores 64
 done up all singersongwriterly the slow jam classic becomes a maudlin joke
 nows a good time to remind vermont that were not in the high age of slacker
 irony anymore the days of the cardigans covering sabbath are long gone and surely
 even these guys can appreciate that these days people just dont get away with
 this kind of thing unless a little something extra is brought to the table
 on chlorine chlorine were given the standard emorock workout while being
 told i like books better than movies gee smart and sensitive do
 i smell a gilmore girls guest shot and the untitled fourth songs denoted by
 a red dot on the sleeve is an adolescence tale of striving for independence from
 mom and dad while lamenting anonymity at the local coffeeshop then theres the
 opener bells of saint alcohol vermonts stab at creating some kind of rote
 emocountry subgenre with a slow rambling tempo and accordion support the
 music is nice enough but add the lyrics to the mix and it sound like castrated
 bright eyes at best
 i could only recommend calling albany to someone if they were really really
 hard up for something new from pedro the lion but even then i couldnt do it with
 an absolute clear conscience as for everyone else i insist you stay as
 far away from this record as possiblemodern technology sure is swell isnt it today modern aircraft technology got
 me from indianapolis to boston in six hours with a stop in newark in between
 modern airport security technology let the people in charge know that i was
 carrying metal objects to my amazement they ignored it and waved me through
 without checking me luckily for them i didnt have a revolver strapped to my
 hip rather i was merely making use of the slightly more archaic pantsretaining
 technology known as a belt buckle
 
 i guess you could say that all of this falls under the umbrella of using technology
 for good even if human misjudgment sometimes interferes with its purpose of
 course human mismanagement spoils a lot of potentially promising technology on a
 regular basis just look at the music industry somewhere along the line bigshot
 producers seem to have picked up the idea that if you take a terrible song and
 dress it up in enough shiny electronic packaging it will become a good song at
 some point the public apparently confirmed that this idea generates large amounts
 of income because its become fairly standard practice
 
 thats just my theory of course naturally i have a lot of corollary theories
 to that one principle among them being that if overproduction can mask a piece
 of crap then it can also mask a gem upon listening to alive to every smile
 trembling blue stars fourth album i found that second theory being proven and
 i grinned like the smug bastard that i am
 
 head star robert wratten formerly of field mice writes some pretty decent songs
 when you break them down to their base elements the melodies are fine if
 unspectacular and the lyrics are better than average broken heart stories
 suffice to say wratten probably has his navel pretty much memorized by now
 unfortunately producer ian catt seems intent on giving alive to every smile
 a bigger sound than it really needs to get its point across a lot of bands
 venture close to softrock territory and come out unscathed trembling blue stars
 arent so lucky
 
 the two greatest offenders come backtoback in the middle of the album here
 all day opens with some syrupy organs over which wratten intones in his
 unbelievably fey voice someone stop the hands of time every ticks a cruel
 blow multitracked female backing vocals swim in lexicon reverb invading the
 second verse before big booming toms ripped straight from a 1984 top 40 station
 provide the final scuttling blow until the dream gets broken follows with
 programmed bongos and the same backing vocals both featured more prominently this
 time the gloss is so blinding that its difficult to see the song underneath
 
 those bloody backing vocals pop up all over the place too and they never once
 truly add anything necessary to the song in question theyre just a distracting
 background texture on the otherwise good ghost of an unkissed kiss the rest
 of the arrangement is fine though drawing from 80s jangle pop and adding in a
 nicely executed backward guitar solo for good measure the refrain of dry eyes
 dry eyes it was never going to end with dry eyes is probably the catchiest
 thing on the album with a slightly dryer mix though it could be more immediate
 
 one improvement wratten and the band have made since their last effort 2000s
 broken by whispers is the fact that their songs now flow a little more
 smoothly from section to section a lot of the songs on that album were plagued
 by jarring transitions from quiet verses to loud seemingly unrelated choruses
 here only one song suffers from that affliction maybe after all opens with
 quietly strummed verses drenched in reverb theres actually a rather neat little
 bit of processed hihat embedded low in the mix too and suddenly transitions
 after a couple of minutes into a dry verse complete with drums bass and some
 nice countermelodic guitar parts and of course before long those damn backing
 vocals are back taking up the space that would have sounded better empty
 
 one of the main reasons alive to every smile turns out so disappointing
 is that it begins on such an interesting note under lock and key opens the
 record with distorted drums and varied tape speeds before a guitar loop enters
 and wratten actually says something assertive for once youve got to stop
 fucking her up youve got to grow up he sings to a guy who presumably isnt
 treating his girlfriend very well wrattens guitar tone is thick and commanding
 it reminds you that he can actually really play the thing well he also handles
 the backing vocals himself which is a plus
 
 with every story actually carries on fairly well from there with wratten
 pulling out a good chord progression and a nice bernard sumnerinspired guitar
 sound but the sheen that plagues the rest of album begins to creep in and by
 the third song theres really no going back closer little gunshots makes
 something of an attempt to darken things a bit with a brooding synth figure but
 the textures turn a little too new agey to be really engaging by the time the
 album ends its easy to find yourself somewhat sick of wrattens merciless
 selfpity too he ends things with the lines youre waving from a leaving
 train and every part of me screams your name think again please think again
 and its a bit of a relief knowing that hes finally done complaining
 
 fans of past trembling blue stars efforts will probably find a lot to enjoy about
 alive to every smile even with the overproduction most other people
 would be pretty welladvised to stay away unless youre desperately seeking an
 indieapproved gateway into the world of lite fm ultimately the band and their
 producer fall into the trap of placing too much stock in technology sadly failing
 to trust wrattens songwriting to work on its own in the end the surface has
 become so smooth that theres almost nothing left to grip at all in the future
 wratten co would do well to put yet another theory to work for them less is
 moreowen is the new miracle drug for the treatment of chronic insomnia the fda has
 begun testing it as anal ternative general anesthesia for certain surgical
 procedures law enforcement officials have suggested using it to subdue
 antiglobalization protesters at this summers wto rally im saying owens
 debut album is going to put you to sleep here people
 
 which is not necessarily a bad thing as i grow older sleep is quickly becoming
 one of my favorite activities and an album that assists me in the process can
 hold a very special place in my collection sedative qualities dont have to
 equal boring it can also mean the music is just pleasant or comforting at the
 end of a long hard day i like nothing more than putting a cd in my stereo and
 gently drifting off to sleep something thats hard to do with the ramones or
 jayz on
 
 owen by the way is not a guy named owen but the solo project of one mike
 kinsella indierock journeyman formerlycurrently of american football joan of
 arc and owls why kinsella would name his oneman band owen rather than say
 mike is a mystery though i like to think that its in tribute to mid80s red
 sox shortstop spike owen not likely but a nice scenario
 
 kinsella pulls off his musical sandman act by primarily utilizing that most sleepy
 of instruments the acoustic guitar eschewing chord strumming for delicate
 dreamy fingerpicking owens songs generally sit on a central riff repeated for
 the three or fourminute duration lulling the listener into a hypnotic state
 kinsellas justaboveawhisper vocals also soothe the ear a million miles away
 from the throaty yelp of his brother tim and generally avoiding typical
 versechorus structure or melody
 
 if this all sounds like an unplugged version of american football youre mostly
 right but the setting is considerably more intimate on owen without kinsellas
 earlier vehicles spiraling guitar epics and octopus drumming also gone is the
 postbreakup open wound nature of american footballs lyrics the raw honesty of
 which could provoke weeping fits or retching depending on ones tolerance for
 emoting
 
 instead owens themes are considerably less traumatic if not exactly sunshine
 and lollipops one song is called declaration of incompetence and when drums
 organic or programmed are added into the mix theyre sedate and simple keeping
 the tunes from floating off into space without disrupting the relaxed tone the
 other instrumental flourishes kinsella adds to the mix vibraphone organ
 strings similarly add depth and color to his compositions without becoming a
 distraction
 
 the combination works best on the album closer think about it which progresses
 patiently through three distinct movements over its sevenminute run time many
 of the tracks are seamlessly blended into one another maintaining the warm
 drowsy glow with brief instrumental passages accidentally serves as the
 strongest of these as kinsella slowly overdubs more and more guitars playing
 complimenting themes until the song builds into a soft cushy pillow of
 zzzzzzzz
 
 whoa sorry about that
 
 given the above description itd be easy to categorize owen as mopecore or
 slowcore or curlupinthefetalpositionandhaveagoodcrycore correct
 too kinsella invites the comparison himself by not too subtly mimicking the red
 house painters on places to go but while owen adds little to the genres
 customary sound one has to admit he does it well by not letting the tortoiselike
 pace get too monotonous
 
 obviously then if this kind of subdued contemplative music makes you want to
 kick someone in the groin owen should not be placed on your tobuy list but
 if youre more receptive to sad white guys making music in their bedroom or if
 your prescription for valium is running out it might be for you just dont
 operate any heavy machinery during usepianist matthew shipp would be infuriatingly overconfident if he didnt back
 himself up so well beginning in 2000 with pastoral composure and moving
 on through new orbit see the phrase in the liner notes cosmic
 consciousness and his work with the david s ware quartet on their corridors
 and parallels the man seems to be suggesting hes onto some kind of
 metaspatial physics thats all his own corridors and parallels may
 actually have been a slight low point for shipp trading piano for korg synthesizer
 might have looked good on paper but in practice the ethereal tones didnt
 integrate well with the earthy flavor of ware co but now shipps back with
 nu bop the latest record in thirsty ears blue series this time around
 hes brought in musician and producer chris flam to add electronic beats to the
 mix and the results are solid
 
 of course you cant approach greatness in jazz without punning on your name so
 nu bop begins with space shipp and the scrunchy beats make themselves
 evident immediately they dont play into fashions like jungle just squelch
 mechanically as shipp pounds along and bassist william parker grooves concordantly
 guillermo e browns percussion rumbles along with the programmed rhythms kicking
 up some hiphop influence and shipp gets inspired and tickles all up and down the
 scales the title track sees parker in funk mode bobbing lightly along with the
 drum breaks until brown adds a whole other layer of bass drum rolls and cymbal
 crashes to the bricolage and speaking of which the breaks not to mention to
 cover art do bear a strong resemblance to amon tobin but then daniel carters
 alto sax wails off in some strangely muted distance and shipp rushes in after
 four minutes like a surprise
 
 flams beats for the most part were laid down before the sessions and taken
 into the studio so the musicians could improvise over them shipps playing is
 based on individual notes rather than the dense harmonic flurries he used to be
 known for the danger of course is pulling a doobop a la miles davis
 downplaying your skills to cut a pop record and grab at hipster cred but shipp
 drops accents in unexpected slightly offmeter places as on ds choice an
 allout jam between shipps monklike plunks browns sharp snaps and some chirpy
 synth beats
 
 shipp may call the album nu bop but the arrangements here
 are more influenced by the birth of the cool the small amount of players allows
 the musical inputs to mix seamlessly and amazingly it never sounds like shipp
 remixed the only time the processing draws attention to itself as something
 added is on select mode 1 a little minuteandahalf throwaway jam whose
 keyboarddemo riddim track should have just been scrapped
 
 zx1 a solo piece by shipp breaks the fast flow of the other tracks for some
 introspection the minorkey chords reverberate from deep in the chamber bringing
 a feeling of melancholy until he slips into the upper registers and becomes
 perplexingly both lighter in tone and yet more tense near the end nu abstract
 finds shipp caged emitting discordant echoes as a nebula of pulsing drones swells
 beneath him hes familiar with this type of soupy ambience from his work on
 spring heel jacks masses project and the piece radiates the same ominous
 vibes but more often this album is about percussive synthesis as on rocket
 shipp with shipp tumbling precariously across the ivories and parker practically
 slapping his bass brown is so energetic and the drum tracks are so interwoven
 that at times its hard to tell where flesh ends and bytes begin
 
 shipp and company have a feat worthy of the fractal juxtapositions and futurist
 font on the album sleeve theyve laid down a fusion record that doesnt fall into
 limp acidjazz wank or pop posturing but to do so they may have sacrificed a
 bit of humor for all the enthusiasm in their playing theyve used a very
 monochromatic palette here the serious tone is most apparent in shipp whose
 dark monolithic thunks bespeak a certain singularity of purpose i find myself
 wishing for another moment or two like xray which features a serene flute
 melody from daniel carter
nu bop doesnt quite reach the lyrical beauty
 of new orbit but its clear that the guys havent set out to do anything
 but record a hell of a funky album as shipp says at the end of a track you
 know it took a minute for my brain to go dead once that happened i was in it
 at forty minutes this is another short but sweet entry in the blue series and
 according to shipp there are more on the wayrelevance in music is overrated as far as i can tell its usually an excuse to
 say i dont understand this or this isnt cool and very rarely an actual
 signifier of the importance something has within a greater context furthermore
 often very interesting ideas can be swept under the rug at the behest of greater
 relevance where was common sense when mozart couldnt get a gig or when decca
 passed up signing the beatles in 1962 because guitar pop was on the way out
 of course you cant really blame the folks who missed out because they really
 werent doing anything worse than living within the framework of their society
 and how can anyone really do better
 
 that said henry rollins latest release nice is utterly irrelevant in the
 context of almost every other album reviewed at pitchfork its too macho to be
 indie too rock to be punk too in your face to tha xtreme to be current too
 guitar center to be amoeba it is certainly too rollins to be subtle or
 multidimensional sure the guy has come a long way since black flag but in
 the wrong direction youd think someone with his iq i cant vouch for that
 but a couple of his spoken word routines had things to ponder would either 1
 find a way to channel his energy into music with as much 2 find a ways make
 something that didnt recall david lee roth solo albums or 3 very quickly find
 a way to make his yellsong vocal stylings more interesting by i dont know not
 yelling every single song all the time
 
 now just because rollins doesnt sound like he has a place among the new rock
 canon doesnt mean that his album is bad but it is one of the least interesting
 things ive heard in a while and that includes terry bradshaw and paul mccartney
 at the superbowl i suppose there is something to be said for him sticking to his
 guns and all but thats all im going to say about that at the moment
 
 hangin around one shot and whats the matter man are all heavy rockers
 featuring a morehypedupthanusual rollins over the top literally of course
 however what really links these tunes is that they could all be featured under a
 wwf highlight reel the band plays with a lot of energy though are necessarily
 in the background to accommodate rollins yelp guitars crunch drums play fills
 that would make terry bozio proud and if muscle is your mode it may work
 however rollins drops lines like whats hard to an alien man well you never
 know whats real huh and i am calm hot animal gratefully guilty as charged
 i see and turns a perfectly acceptable cockrock session into incredibly bad
 poetry
 
 a couple of left turns do spice up the mix up for it is something of a james
 brown tribute with fauxmother popcorn guitar and slinky groove the day to
 day can become such a trip the mediocre can make you lose your grip now he
 tells me rollins does the godfather one better by bringing in some pointer
 sistersesque background singers and uttering the phrase im up for it not
 less than 28 times during the song i want so much more starts out on a bad
 foot james brown would never do that by letting us know that rollins
 wants so much more four times at the beginning of the song and retaining the
 soul singers who to their credit are probably doing as well with the material
 as you could expect however its downtempo groove machine gun trumpet hits
 yes and ornery sax solo do make it something of a 70s copshow backalleychase
 soundtrack anyway its the most distinctive tune on the disc so enjoy it while
 it lasts
 
 other tunes range from rigid fake zep hello to bythenumbers punk gone
 inside the zero which should be a surprise though music probably isnt
 rollins main game in fact i wonder what would happen if rollins were to ever
 attempt making another punk record he seems to have plenty to say and the
 energy level thing wont be an issue the funny thing with him is that since he
 doesnt seem to care about his image anymore which could be cool in itself
 youd think hed be making records that challenged someones idea of what new
 rock sounded like no dice but dont lose faith because rollins wants so much
 more he wants so much more henry rollins wants so much moreat 22 minneapolis mc eyedeas trophy case sports a fair amount of ghetto chic

 pulling a lyrical kaiser soze with his retrospective battling on big shots his
 lyrical talents are no less impressive than his mood swings showing variation in
 meter tempo and vocal tone although its always a little nasally and heavy on
 enunciation
 
 the beats and scratches from the mind and wrists of abilities are comparatively
 simple the simplicity rears its head in the drums you wont hear much more than
 firm straightforward machinebeats on first born no copped drum breaks
 shuffles or funky percussion just beats just background the rest of the mix
 however is a bit more jazzy and quirky blending piano flute organ vamps
 vibraphones and some basic samples then of course theres abilities abilities
 the wheels of steel which blend skillfully in the mix without sounding too
 apparent his restraint lends a good deal of coherence to the album
 
 unfortunately this simplistic sound also leads to a mix too weak and reserved for
 eyedeas ample mic skills is there a rule against pairing complex wicked beats
 with hype mcs must we save these beats for trick daddy you get the feeling
 that any track with an mc as biting and incisive as eyedea with a vocal tone
 with as much attack as his could really bounce eyedea would benefit from more
 bass more breaks generally more flavor for a large part of the album i was
 thinking remix or possibly elp
 
 so the beats could use improvement but the bottom line is eyedea hes good his
 rhymes are dense literate focused often surprising and always amusing expect
 much more out of the kid especially given the undie resurgence of 2001 def jux
 clan in particular in the meantime first borns out there if you want
 itthe chicagobased boxhead ensemble first convened in 1996 under the direction of
 the lofty pillars michael krassner to provide the soundtrack for dutch
 harbor a short documentary chronicling life on a remote aleutian island its
 core members krassner violinist jessica billey pinetop seven bassist ryan
 hembrey percussionist glenn kotche now the drummer for wilco supercellist
 fred lonbergholm and exsouled american guitarist scott tuma created a unique
 fusion of country jazz classical and postrock noise augmented by the inclusion
 of an itinerant band of musical cohorts the resulting sound an eccentric
 exquisite genrebender became a kind of introspective late night standard for
 devotees of the beautifully cool or coolly beautiful
 
 in early 2001 the core members reconvened after a hiatus allowing for further
 entries on their already impressive resumes to record two brothers with
 the musical assistance of such luminaries as wilcos jeff tweedy jim white and
 mick turner of the dirty three and jeff parker of tortoise and isotope 217
 
 that two brothers doesnt sound a whole hell of a lot like anything else
 is commendable but tricky its a testament to krassners direction that the
 individual players coalesce into a single sound a true ensemble if you will
 however the first blush consumer who buys this disc for the trademark sound of
 one of its contributors will find herself spending hours in front of the speakers
 trying to pick apart the sounds unless your ear is a lot better than mine youll
 probably give up and consider that krassners decision to not list the players on
 each track merely forwards the premise of creating a true ensemble
 
 the thematic core here seems to be the subversion of traditional american song
 this is fairly dark stuff and i mean that quite literally krassner prefers the
 minor key and most of the songs are performed at a dirgelike tempo with
 billeys plaintive violin and lonbergholms cello providing the meat of the
 melody the mournful variation when johnny comes marching home ushers in a
 trio of affecting cuts including the haunting 18minute title cut the
 halflight which features gregorios impressive clarinet work and the
 gorgeous requiem a violin line that calls to mind a patch of desolate
 american gothic will suddenly give way to a sampled siren listener loss of
 context may ensue
 
 for an album that carefully dances around the edges of the avantgarde two
 brothers never stings you with its pretensions listening to this record is
 near effortless and at the risk of sounding romantic and maudlin ill shy from
 using words like transcendent even if that is what comes to mindmike fellows has symptoms of sidemans disease it strikes when youve spent
 too much time out of the spotlight the leader of the band stands up front telling
 every man woman and child in the room to squeeze his lemon the sideman hangs
 back and makes sure his bass stays in tune he helps load the tshirts into the
 van though his face is never on them someone has to sell the show and someone
 has to keep it together
 miighty flashlight is mike fellows fellows played bass for seminal dc hardcore
 band rites of spring he was one of the members who didnt later play in fugazi
 hes worked with such altcountry vips as papa m will oldham and the silver
 jews now armed only with a couple guitars a powerbook and his downhome vocals
 fellows has a solo project to record and tour with his own songs his debut album
 is a short backyard barbecue with high potential and mild impact
 over his acoustic and electric guitars fellows gently adds samples with his
 powerbook managing to stray far from obvious or clumsy sounds and only upon
 close inspection do you notice how extensively he uses these sounds for accents
 ambience or even the foundation of a tune as with the catchy flute hook of
 ventilating zephyrs or the effects that gird the melody of hala hanan di
 halida the instrumental go on die its easy layers subtle sounds over the
 acoustic guitars from a low buzzing drone to a drum machine fill that may be
 miighty flashlights only clich on other tracks the piano samples sound
 like they come from an upright sitting in fellows living room and his vocals
 subdued a little raw and sometimes hard to interpret fit right in without
 knocking anything loose he sings like the guy at a party who mutters sures
 been tough since the wife left like he wants you to know but wont make a big
 deal of it
 unfortunately the perfect arrangements make the album a bit too subtle it doesnt
 rock and it doesnt ache ballet skool has grown on me with its spare electric
 guitar line and its connotations of regrets and mistakes but like most of the
 lyrics here the words are cryptic and its difficult to discern what fellows is
 trying to say on top of ballet school dont let me be misdiagnosed and as
 for the three instrumentals go on is more than enough the other two
 fatherland focus and forget this space are built on subjohn fahey riffs
 that just coast by unconvincingly these songs might be likeable and masterfully
 crafted but they could use an extra kick to keep us interestedwere all suckers for sentimentality but typically we ourselves choose the objects
 of our sentiment and find it irritating to have to endure anothers listening to
 hefners latest release dead media comes across as just such a laborious
 experience for whatever reason hefner made a conscious decision to strip down
 their sound retreating to their bedrooms with analog synths and an eighttrack
 recorder to cop thoreau to record so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to
 rout all that was not music to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive music
 into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms the result of this selfimposed
 hermeticism is neither mean nor sublime but simply trite whats good for the
 soul isnt necessarily good for the ear
 jan hammer and yaz are good in small doses but theyre mostly good for a chuckle
 i might download a few tracks in homage to sonny crockett ricardo tubbs and
 immortal miami pastel cool but id never want to sit through an entire album of
 hollow preprogrammed beats and electronic handclaps with this release hefner
 apparently feels its time for a revival of these clichs
dead media works on occasion but primarily when hefner revert to the
 traditional pop trio format of bass guitar drums songs like the king of
 summer show off the bands potential songwriting prowess but most of the songs
 here are blatantly precious and generally as awkward as their primary subject
 matter puppy love and early teenage sexuality peppermint taste is a fine
 example a reminiscence of a first kiss and feelup under a tree which tries to
 counter the obvious and squeamish delivery with what i imagine are supposed to be
 biting comments now its been twenty years i bet you kiss real good i bet you
 kiss your banker like a bankers wife should as with most of the attempts at
 irony throughout dead media it falls flat
 the only track in this experimental mode that works is alan bean a major tomstyle
 space adventure thats successful because the campy synths and space sounds give
 the song a cartoonish quality that belies its desperation and hope there are
 also some passable songs like junk and when the angels play their drums but
 then there are others like china crisis which are handled so ineptly that they
 inspire three solid minutes of cringing
 its clear that hefners intention was to take complete control of the creative
 process by living with these machines for a while and to create a little
 masterpiece of brian wilsonesque simplicity and charm but obviously theyre
 not quite so deft with this equipment as wilson was and it all comes off as a
 bunch of sophomoric tinkering if they felt that this amateurish sound would
 illicit a flood of vintage memories and a collective sentimental sigh of
 recognition they were just plain wrong for me it actually has the opposite
 effect a shriek of recognition and a dash for the stop button youre better
 off sticking with vintage pet shop boys and abcafter listening to age of the sun i feel safe making an assumption the
 bill doss formerly of the olivia tremor control really likes the beatles the
 sun and psychedelic drugs and with good reason in small doses all three are
 great things liable to cheer you up or at the very least illuminate a situation
 in a way uniquely their own but too much of any of these things can be a problem
 too much sun will give you cancer too much beatles will leave your mind a mess of
 muddled harmonies celebrity worship and lame conspiracy theories too many
 psychedelic drugs will turn you into a selfobsessed freak like say neus
 klaus dinger
 
 too much this is a problem that the bill doss has theres lots of good stuff on
 age of the sun the new album from his newish band the ahem sunshine
 fix its just that sometimes theres a bit too much of it
 
 take that sun for example its in the name of the band its in the title of the
 album its one of the first and last words sung on the album and more than half
 the songs appropriate it as a theme now doubtless the sun plays an important
 role in all of our lives the loyal vampire portion of pitchforks readership
 notwithstanding but this sort of obsessiveness is just plain unhealthy unhealthy
 and tiresome just as a bright sunny day can come as a slap in the face if
 youre in the wrong mood so too can this constant elaboration on the same theme
 get a little irritating
 
 the music on the other hand doesnt which comes as something of a surprise its
 not everyday that i a bitter wearied critic stumble upon pop music varied enough
 that it not only grabs my attention but also hangs onto it granted theres
 nothing on age of the sun thats quite up to par with the work of doss
 former bandmate circulatory systems will cullen hart but then little more
 than constant disappointment can come from expecting every record to be a
 masterpiece
 
 but age of the sun does have some very strong moments like the two wobbly
 distorted guitars that do battle on the instrumental track inside the nebula
 while crackling static and a sturdy bassline keep time as this short number nears
 its end a simple piano melody lingers in the background before everything cuts
 out then back in then back out then back in then out for good if that bit of
 piano sounds familiar its because its playing the same fauxragtime bit that
 served as a bridge between everything is waking one of the most otcsounding
 songs on the album replete with a melancholy refrain with vocal harmonizing and
 guitar riffs right off the white album and digging to china one of the
 more straightforward tracks here
 
 the sunshine fix is a bit more straightforward than otc or circulatory system
 sure lots of the trademarks remain songs linked together by stray musical
 digressions short bits of strangeness between songs recurring singsong melodies
 etc but theres more focus here on the pop than the psychedelic thats not to
 say age of the sun isnt without its outthere psychedelic moments just
 that doss is more interested in layering piles of horns guitars bass drums
 strings organs harmonizing vocals and feedback on top of each other for that
 glorious wall of sound effect than he is in twisting your mind around in circles
 from chasing after stray bits of hallucinatory noise gone awry
 
 ultimately this is a pretty solid effort especially from the man often assumed
 to be the lesser half of the otc equation sure there are moments that get
 annoying like le roi soleil which ends the album by stretching one syllables
 vocal harmony over the course of twenty minutes and sure the whole ordeal could
 benefit from a bit of thematic variety but there are also lots of strong moments
 like the way the simple acoustic number cycles of time serves as a breather
 following the swarming grandiose of 72 years age of the suns grand
 finale provided you discount le roi
age of the sun may not be the defining achievement of pop music that
 black foliage was and it may not reach quite the heights of his counterpart
 harts finest efforts but its still one of the stronger straightup pop albums
 ive heard in a while at his worst doss is prone to overindulgence but at his
 best he proves himself a morethancapable songwriter and arranger if he ever
 learns to respect his limitations why theres no telling what he might achieveken stringfellow is something like powerpop royalty not only is he a great
 songwriter responsible for half of the music of the posies but hes also kept
 his plate constantly full over the last decade working with everyone from rem
 to big star to scott mccaughey to ringo starr the posies are the hardest working
 defunct band in show business stringfellow and fellow posie john auer have
 released more material since the bands breakup than most bands release in an
 entire career
 
 and in the midst of all this ken found time to start yet another band a group
 called saltline that only managed to record one ep before splitting this left
 stringfellow with a bunch of songs just lying around doing nothing so he penned
 up a few more and put them all to work on his second solo album touched
 true to form its not a bad batch of tunes
 
 stringfellow allows the country tendencies that have always lurked in his
 songwriting to come to the fore on the opener down like me ron prestons steel
 guitar swells in and out of the mix and drummer eric marshall keeps things moving
 at a quick clip as stringfellow serves up one of the sticky melodies weve by now
 come to expect from him mitch easters production is clean and uncluttered but
 it sometimes lacks the punch of the posies best efforts like 1993s excellent
 frosting on the beater
 
 this ones on you pulls back the reins and turns back the clock to roughly the
 time when bernie leadon was still in the eagles one of the posies main
 strengths was always the harmonies of auer and stringfellow here minus auer
 stringfellow simply layers his own voice and while this works well enough theres
 a certain balance that auers voice brought to the harmonies of the posies thats
 lacking on touched on his own stringfellows voice also has a somewhat
 alarming tendency to sound like timothy b schmidt on the high notes but
 this only happens rarely
 
 stringfellow naturally includes a few of the powerpop gems that he does so well
 like the sloanesque find yourself alone at first glance the song is catchy
 and wellperformed with a monster chorus but a closer listen reveals several
 piano and rhodes tracks filling out the background adding immensely to the
 overall texture of the song if only there were radio stations somewhere that
 would play this stuff
 
 uniforms begins over a bed of cello and violin but quickly segues into loping
 pop full of cleanly strummed guitars harpsichord and even a bit of distant
 clipclop percussion nicked straight from pet sounds atmospheric synths
 gradually enter the mix only to give way to a piano interlude that lays the
 groundwork for the last few verses the rhythm pushes forward harder than before
 and layers of synth wash underneath stringfellows multitracked voice its an
 impressive little opus that uses a keen sense of arrangement to its fullest
 advantage
 
 sparrow is the best of an impressive quartet of classic powerpop songs with
 one of the albums finest melodies topping another inventive arrangement
 stringfellow makes use of his lowest range in the prechorus over fuzzedout
 guitars and organs and offers some impressive guitar and keyboard work in the
 instrumental bridge the hammondsoaked reveal love comes down a notch
 eschewing guitar entirely in the verses but still offering a massive chorus
 designed to rattle around your head for days afterward
 
 but while the more upbeat numbers on touched are uniformly flawless
 things get spotty when stringfellow departs from that route one morning is
 a fine enough acoustic song full of nicely layered vocals and a great melody
 but its followed by spanish waltz a song that feels somewhat labored it
 veers between some forced distorted passages and vaguely psychedelic sections
 with odd little guitar parts battling with stringfellows otherwise good vocal
 melody theres a bombast to the song thats simply unbecoming a songwriter like
 stringfellow whose primary strength is melody
 
 its followed by fireflies a quiet pensive song where the guitar and drums are
 actually more prominent than the vocals it works well as a mood piece or
 interlude but little else but its on the lovers hymn where he really veers
 off course the aforementioned timothy b schmidt resemblance hinted at earlier
 is in a full bloom here and the song practically sounds like an outtake from the
 sessions for the long run at more than five minutes its extremely overlong
 and never really develops itself beyond the organcoated verses with the
 exception of some somewhat interesting instrumental bits presented in lieu of a
 chorus
 
 thankfully stringfellow gets his bearings again for the closer heres to the
 future and ending touched in the same territory that big stars third
 album occupied 25 years ago what begins as an acoustic song is shrouded in a
 blanket of analog synthesizer during the crescendos between verses and marshall
 punctuates it with orchestral percussion its a fitting close to a fine solo
 effort thats not afraid to take a few chances no one really knows at this point
 what will become of the posies but as long as stringfellow keeps putting out
 music in some form the future of powerpop looks okayive been considering ways to dole out an introduction to this review for nearly
 two weeks each attempt more futile than the last i considered keeping a diary
 of listening and actually went so far as to do it on a number of occasions
 piecing together thoughts and hoping something cohesive would come of it
 rereading my scribbles i realized that it was like fitting the jumbled pieces
 of a puzzle together every entry referenced something wholly other than what
 had preceded it inevitably part of it became personal so i nixed it still
 the task became a vital part of this almost as if i had lived inside the sounds
 of neon golden drifting in and out of song mixing familiar with unknown
 moving above and beneath the textures and never completely keeping time in the
 end its apt that this resulted from a notwist record the last decade for them
 was full of shifting movements
 beginning in weilheim germany in the early 90s as a heavy metal outfit markus
 and micha acher along with drummer martin messerschmid released two albums
 filled with pounding drums and guitar solos the notwist and nook
 before almost abandoning it completely however with nook things had
 already started to change interests moved away from thudding power riffs and
 toward the direction of complex rhythms and structures even so to listen to
 those albums now most people would find it difficult to believe the same band
 made this new disc
 in the mid90s the notwist finally got an american distributor with 12
 on the nowdefunct zero hour label with that they began to explore even more
 textures in their sound enlisting martin gretschmann aka console to help with
 production and add his special electronic touch resulting in a more poppy sound
 for the group some might even call it indie rock 12s beauty is startling
 from beginning to end
 with martin console now in tow as a fulltime member shrink was a huge
 step into the world of electronic music and sounded almost completely unlike
 anything else made at the time mixing rock and pop with free jazz oldtimey
 folk jagged minimalist beats and just about anything else you could toss in
 i dont have any problems saying now that the record was ahead of its time to
 top it off the shame in it all is that very few took notice zero hour went belly
 up rendering 12 and shrink virtually impossible to find in record shops
 these days and the notwist went back to germany and sort of disappeared for a
 few years
 so it seemed console never really slowed down releasing a ton of solo projects
 one of which was 1999s matadorreleased rocket in the pocket remixing
 just about everyone and doing the programming and production on possibly the best
 track from bjrks vespertine heirloom the list of notwist side
 projects became quite lengthy too tied and tickled trio sax player johannes
 enders continuing project village of savoonga potawatomi and lali puna to
 name a few so after four years of what only seemed like hiding the acher
 brothers and the martins console and messerschmid return with neon golden
 their website says it was worth the wait and well its true
neon golden is replete with textured sounds drifting and occasionally
 driving pulsations and mesmerizing hypnorhythms its been quite a while since
 the last time i actually felt ive been with a record like this sounds odd but
 thats exactly the feeling ive received over the last two weeks and when youve
 got that much time to spend with a record it becomes an entity in and of itself
 most times with a record review you get a few precursory listens and then by
 number five or six youre spitting out a review not so here with well over
 fifty listens to this disc its like a relationship has begun to spring forth
 out of the ether i guess you could say neon golden and me have become
 well acquainted and its already akin to hanging with an old friend given that
 amount of time realizations occur one of my first was that in many ways this
 record is about textures electronic bleats pulsing waves the mixture of organic
 instruments with digital blips and loops and most notably the serenity of markus
 achers voice
 while achers singing has always been appealing to me it wasnt until this album
 that i finally recognized something and for you lyric analysts its probably not
 a good thing ive found myself spending more time listening to achers voice than
 paying attention to what exactly hes singing about in some ways its similar to
 arto lindsay on albums like mundo civilizado when hes singing in
 portuguese its unclear exactly what hes talking about yet his ability to
 mesmerize and captivate the listener with his singing can be simply haunting and
 damn if his voice just doesnt ooze sex appeal a very similar thing often occurs
 when im listening to acher the songs are sung in english i know the words and
 i can sing along thing is my attention becomes devoted to the way his phrases
 are formed his ability to roll words off his tongue the manner in which certain
 syllables consonants and vowels are stressed and the way familiar english words
 all at once become foreign on this room theres a moment at around the 130
 mark where the driving percussion suddenly comes to a delirious halt and leaving
 only achers voice imbedded in a wave of electronic gurgles and throbbing beats
 the track is rendered into two halves here achers voice cutup and pieced back
 together in a dizzying loop bouncing off itself in nonsense halfsyllables and
 creating a splitsecond feel of nauseainducing vertigo
 elsewhere a track like one step inside doesnt mean youll understand is
 comprised of plucked strings atop a low saxophone moan while hisses and crackles
 burble just below the surface waiting for the end of the song and fading out
 with the hum of nothing but fuzz as if the stylus was just caught in a locked
 groove prior to that fading hum thin layers of sound begin to unfurl themselves
 something that transpires on almost every track whether it be the distinguishing
 notwist banjo clanking percussion or the layer upon layer of electronics even on
 neon goldens most driving track pilot the band allows space for those
 resonating electronic hums to break through
 and then another realization the notwist have an uncanny knack for allowing
 their compositions room to breathe creating lush sonic textures dynamic numbers
 like pilot or pick up the phone come off as thoughtful and unhurried songs
 transitioning into each other with languid movements pick up the phone is
 awash in spastic pointyheaded beats and it sounds like the feel of crumpled and
 uncrumpled candy wrappers with markus acher singing in what sometimes sound like
 barely hushed whispers neon golden begins to take on an introspective
 beauty almost as if everything the musicians the singer the music is lost in
 contemplative thought
 nowhere is this pensiveness more present than in tracks like neon golden or
 off the rails the muted tranquil beauty of an acoustic guitar and markus
 acher crooning this is all i know gently over electronic washes of sound in the
 latter make for lullaby material neon golden on the other hand begins as a
 gritty dirge containing a deep saxophone groan plucked acoustic guitar and banjo
 and the mantralike title chant as it progresses though the song begins to be
 taken over by drops of scattered percussion rhythmic drums congas and the
 murmuring buzz of consoles electronic manipulations at first my feelings for
 consequence were ambivalent but now i see that its the perfect choice for a
 closing song markus achers lovely plaintive moan of leave me hypnotized
 love leave me paralyzed love is the one time when the lyrics stand against
 the backdrop of the song stark and revelatory neon golden can do exactly
 what hes singing it leaves you mesmerized lost in meditative thought and
 captivated by the grainy exquisite textures
neon golden would be a staggering feat for any band much less a band most
 people had long since forgotten about or maybe never really knew a decade into
 their career the notwist have created a masterpiece by pulling the same trick
 they pulled on shrink mixing things that might not seem to fit together
 into a beautiful seamless whole again the unfortunate thing is that anyone
 outside europe is going to have a difficult time getting their hands on a copy
 if you do find one be prepared to pay as city slang stuff just aint that cheap
 in the usa so why havent labels like mute or communion or darla jumped on
 getting this available for domestic distribution yet a more obvious choice would
 even be matador who recently released one of consoles albums domestically as
 of right now the notwist have released the record of the year its a shame that
 most people might not have a chance to hear itif you were in your late teens and lived near chicago between 1996 and 1999
 chances are you were a braid fan too young to have caught smashing pumpkins
 before they mutated into arenarock dinosaurs and too rambunctious to chinstroke
 along with mcentire and orourke the angstfilled masses turned to braid you
 could count on the champaign foursome to play through the area once every month
 or two filling up the metro or the fireside bowl with bobbing heads and squinty
 rockout faces melodramatic lyrics fugaziesque startstops time signature
 chaos and an excellent balance of hardcore mentality and catchy melodicism
 what more could a midwestern eighteen yearold ask for
 
 i know because i was there pumping my fist to first day back with the rest of
 you and thats why i cant decide whether im disappointed or just plain angry
 about the vanilla icecream blandness of everynight fire works see hey
 mercedes is 75 of what once was braid their answer to saved by the bell the
 college years if you will when braid broke up in early 2000 i took comfort
 in the fact that threequarters of the band would continue on under a new moniker
 without the services of guitaristscreamyguy chris broach their first
 selftitled ep was an unimpressive effort but live shows featured a number of
 unrecorded songs with potential
 
 then hey mercedes broke from polyvinyl records the home of such respectable
 midwesterners as amfm and aloha for vagrant records the home of critically
 acclaimed artists like hmmm help me out here snapcase well anyway
 given vagrants habit of churning out slick poppunk product for chainwallet
 accessorisors that just came down off a bad blink182 bender the warning flags
 were raised
 
 and indeed these warning flags proved accurate upon the release of everynight
 fire works under the increasingly commercialminded guidance of j robbins
 every rough edge is polished up to a shimmering radiofriendly gleam close your
 eyes and you can imagine most of these songs on mtv maybe with the band in funny
 wigs and playing to a house full of underwearclad teenagers
 
 still robbins helmed the boards on braids final and finest fulllength frame
 and canvas so the blame cannot rest solely with him frontman bob nanna
 seems determined to dumb down his songs to reach a wider audience trading in the
 polyrhythms and unusual dynamics of old for power chords power chords power
 chords sure theres a few stuttersteps in tracks like alist actress and
 the frowning of a lifetime but more common are songs like our weekend starts
 on wednesday and what youre up against which roll along with little variation
 in tempo or volume
 
 the onedimensional nature of the album leads me to say words i never thought id
 utter i miss chris broach while his contributions to braid albums often seemed
 limited to emphatically yelling yeah every once in a while hey mercedes is
 sorely lacking the hard vocal counterpoint broach would play to nannas sensitive
 guy act also absent is the intricate instrumental interplay between broach and
 nanna as guitarist mark dawursk adds little to indicate that hey mercedes even
 needs two sixstrings
 
 frustratingly a couple songs still manage to strike direct hits on my old
 braidlovin soul every turn features the kind of acrobatically catchy vocal
 nanna used to specialize in writing with a great crunchy chorus tailormade for
 the athome rockout album closer lets go blue layers a tiny little riff over
 a chugging chord progression and works well until resorting to that most tired
 of devices the bass and drums breakdown
 
 818 of everynight fire works however inspires nothing more than a yawn
 and bittersweet nostalgia the mediocrity reaches its apex with quit five
 minutes so lacking in hooks and creativity that it feels ten times as long even
 before the textbook falseending and buildup coda
 
 of course its completely possible that ive just outgrown the target audience
 for nanna co somewhere in suburbia im guessing theres a fifteen yearold
 kid just now discovering hey mercedes and thinking theyre the greatest thing
 ever more power to little ricky he could be listening to a lot worse and
 maybe my dissatisfaction means im actually disappointed and angry with myself
 for outgrowing that rockin inner teenager and becoming a crotchety old foge
 
 no wait thats not right im disappointed and angry about hey mercedes
 impossibly middling debut album sorry dont know what got into me therebands like windy carl and stars of the lid are on quest for the perfect drone
 they are purists continually honing their craft and chipping away at the excess
 going on the assumption that a lean and efficient music machine is better equipped
 to tune into the ultimate vibration these methods have led both bands toward a
 polished and pleasant sound relatively far afield from their coarse fourtrack
 beginnings and theres no doubting the efficacy of this refinement as
 consciousness and the tired sounds of stars of the lid were
 excellent albums that ranked with each bands finest
 
 and then theres sunroof where other bands see drone as a state of relaxation
 in which the listener finds himself in harmony with his surroundings sunroof
 channels the raw unknowable patterns of nature into a music thats dense harsh
 loud and endless miles removed from the soothing hum these monolithic sound
 constructions seem hacked from the world of ambient noise with a dull hatchet
 theyre crude shapeless and drooping with stray connective tissue and yet
 in their own way theyre also very beautiful
 
 before we get into the music on bliss a little background sunroof come
 from a music community seemingly designed with the obsessive music fan in mind
 those looking for an obscure psychedelic noise scene populated by enigmatic
 characters prone to issuing scores of hyperlimited records to pad a massive and
 completely unmanageable discography need look no further than the skullflower
 the band was formed in rural england in 1985 and members went on to perform and
 record in various configurations under the names ramleh consumer electronics ax
 novatron ascension and jfk and thats just for starters sunroof is the name
 exskullflower guitarist mathew bower now uses for his solo projects he previously
 released albums under the name total the 2xcd bliss is actually the
 second album released by sunroof in 2001 the first was the vinylonly sad
 frog wind which featured two sidelong compositions full of guitar feedback
 synthesizer oscillations and assorted bells and chimes it was an impressive
 record but bliss is more diverse and ultimately packs a bigger punch
 
 the first two tracks make up one long piece bearing the intriguing title columbine
 kisses it begins with a halfsecond of bass rumble and then a cheap tinny drum
 machine taps out a wobbly rhythm seeming somehow feeble and out of place next to
 the drone waves of feedback eventually submerge the rhythm box and yet it remains
 barely audible a few leagues below the drone managing to mark the time amid the
 relentless noise though the track will strike some as difficult listening sunroof
 brilliantly walks the tightrope between noise and drone music proper bliss
 never comes close to merzbow territory upping the overall playability but always
 maintains an abrasive edge that keeps the music firmly in the foreground
 
 gold carnation legacy is one of a few tracks built around the kind of oscillating
 synth drone that anchored spacemen 3s epic suicide the fluttering tones
 accelerate and decelerate unpredictably and woven through the spaces are bowed
 strings and guitars that sound like whale songs distoria emphasizes percussion
 and unorthodox guitar technique one noise might be an electric guitar being sawed
 in half another guitar is struck to sound like a series of bells revealing the
 strong influence of the indian raga on bowers music the blue sky of china is
 even more overt in this respect coaxing the long winding melody lines of a sitar
 into a bed of distortion
 
 bells is the rare slice of tranquility on the first disc of bliss as
 comparatively tame guitar feedback is sculpted into what could be an aural essay
 on the healing properties of sunlight the shorter second disc of bliss
 comes a bit closer to evoking its title dirty joke from outer space is a
 collection of bubbly synth oscillations mixed with bird sounds and when sheets
 of feedback ultimately rise in the mix theyre relaxed and welcoming dance of
 the blessed spirits serves to highlight the homespun nature of the sunroof
 project as the voice of a child near the microphone talks and sings along with
 the extended tones
 
 this track like many others throughout bliss begins and ends abruptly
 while this is probably due to the rudimentary nature of the recording environment
 these jarring transitions give the illusion that these pieces actually go on
 forever and that the listener just happened to drop in on them for a few minutes
 i like to think that somewhere in the world at this very moment another sunroof
 drone is raging and i can only hope theres a tape machine nearby to capture itin our jaded cynical time few things are sacred you dont tug on supermans
 cape you dont spit into the wind you dont pull the mask off that ol lone
 ranger and you dont mess around with freeform radio after all freeform radio

 corporate america as a trustworthy politician so on june 11th 1984 when
 listeners tuned into over the edge the weekly freeform show hosted by socalled
 sonic outlaws and collage artists supreme negativland only to hear 70s schmaltz
 standbys like billy dont be a hero and rock me gently its understandable
 why they might be upset
 
 though they may be better known for their studio releases and legal battles
 negativlands probably spent more time over the last two decades at a small
 california freeform station than they have in any studio or courtroom their
 shows are as unpredictable as they come long mixes full of choppedup pop
 culture oddball characters weird pranks and audience participation callers
 to the station are generally placed immediately on the air and allowed to
 interact however they please so long as they dont say the forbidden word
 hello a few such moments are included in this package in a segment called
 ringo starr is dead the group tells their audience that starr has died of a
 drug overdose and feigns a tribute chopping up and destroying beatles music
 while callers grieve express doubt and eventually curse them as their hoax
 comes unraveled
 
 but on that fateful day in june something went wrong all anyone really knew
 for certain was that some asshole by the name of dick vaughn had taken over
 negativlands time slot and where previously they had tuned in for hours of
 chaotic unpredictable sound experiments now there was only muskrat love what
 many listeners didnt realize was that dick vaughn was little more than a creation
 of negativland the latest in a long line of characters why did no one suspect
 that dick was the work of these wellknown pranksters most probably did but
 lots of people bought into it and the angry phone calls preserved in this a new
 expanded twodisc reissue of one of negativlands finest over the edge
 releases live on as proof
 
 other negativland creations stop by for moments of delightful radio trickery too
 including visits from longtime staples like the irrepressibly irate homosexual
 weatherman nasally cultural reviewer crosley bendix and the gluttonous dean of
 psychiatric broadcasting dr oslo norway but the real focus here is dick
 probably among the least beloved of any of negativlands characters an
 ambitiousyettasteless radio personality and incurable phone prankster the
 first disc of this release presents moments from california superstation dicks
 first misguided attempt at radio wherein he plays a bunch of vapid irritating
 games with the audience and manages to irritate an entire listening base in a mere
 five hours also included is an assortment of dick vaughns phone pranks
 apparently not content with destroying his own radio shows dick was notorious
 for calling up other real radio shows and wrecking havoc on the air
 
 disc two documents moribund music of the 70s purportedly the firstever 70s
 nostalgia radio show hosted by vaughn in 1984 splicing vocal segments of dicks
 show with various listener phonecalls both hateful and praising and assorted
 strange noises these clips are interspersed with recordings of offair phone
 surveys where one member of the group asks unsuspecting listeners what they
 think of vaughns show while the rest of the group constantly interrupts the
 conversation with a barrage of mostly vulgar soundbytes which of course
 everyone but the baffled surveytaker fails to notice
 
 i enjoyed these moments thoroughly but then i might be biased to the
 nonnegativlandobsessed pranks like these while certainly fun might eventually
 get a little old without the thrill of listening to such shenanigans live they
 do lose some of their spark and vitality and as with any comedy album whats
 funny the first time around may not sit so well on repeated listens still the
 compilation works as a history lesson and it makes what comes next that much
 more amazing
 
 the last quarter of this 150 minutelong collection is dedicated to dicks death
 in a fiery plane crash no less and his subsequent postmortem appearances
 which include a dying plea captured on the flight recorded and tapes prepared in
 case of untimely death negativland pays homage to the recently deceased in a
 segment called dick is dead a truly bizarre collage which is equal parts
 minced 70s cheese black box recordings from plummeting planes strange characters
 crying babies and funky basslines
 
 ultimately this set is not unlike the rest of negativlands over the edge
 collections without a doubt it contains moments of sheer brilliance but
 theres so much material to wade through that it might as well come with a sticker
 that says for true obsessives only fans of the groups antics will inevitably
 eat this up but for those just coming to the table for the first time one of the
 groups more proper studiobound efforts might serve as a better appetizer for
 what its worth escape from noise and the now outofprint u2 are
 the classics though a big 108 place is my personal favorite
 
 of course
 for a certain crowd those who like myself believe radio can be something more
 than the record industrys favorite whore theres a certain magic to dick vaughn
 even in its lessthanstellar moments moribund music of the 70s is still
 oddly fascinating theres always a certain risk inherent a feeling that not
 only is it possible that everything might go wrong live on the air but that its
 likely too that puts these recordings on a plane far removed from most anything
 else going out over the airwaves these days for those who still believe that art
 can be dangerous that theres still a place in this world for true noholdsbarred
 freeform radio negativland continue to reign both as innovators and as
 inspirationsin the laptop world its a tough gig to make convincing dub music as the
 exemplary reissue label blood and fire demonstrates with their every release dub
 is all about the clash of human creativity and technological ineptitude king
 tubby and lee scratch perry were pioneers because they overcame the gulf between
 their imaginations and the thriftstore sound equipment they had access to thus
 tubby relied on the beloved primitive sound effects of accidental tapehiss and
 dropouts as much he relied on the echo chamber very few presentday digidubbers
 resist the temptation to defuzz and cleanse their rootical offerings like ryan
 moores twilight circus dub sound system and oswald von moritzs rhythm and sound
 project the austrian quartet sofa surfers relish and emulate the mystical lofi
 glamour of classic dub
 but unlike moore and von moritz sofa surfers are not mere copyists cargo
 the bands unnerving and astounding debut album plotted a course from crooklyn
 dub container and ital wisdom sweat to massive attackish futurefunk
 triphop the low rider and avantmetal rastafarian hiphop beans and rice
 the remix album constructions magnified cargos oppressive
 hydroponic power with dubs and reworkings by such sunshy sunkencheeked masters
 of the outthere slomo roller as spectre mad professor howie b and eardrum
encounters is no doubt intended as a continuation of the collaborative
 aesthetic of constructions yet despite sofa surfers valiant attempts
 the record suffers occasionally from threadbare talent having a shoddy go at
 underground hiphop or slouchy lounge ballads in such cases sofa surfers
 relegate themselves to providing moody soundscapes for their guests to faff around
 in however when they encounter true talent the quartet approaches the essential
 toughness of cargo
 this record opens with formula featuring wouldbe macker sensational and his
 claims about being the real deal and too much for ya sensational rides a
 crisp drumtrack similar to cargos container and axelrody breaks that
 dj shadow and other cratediggers have been appropriating for years the
 thesaurusplundering wordplay continues with oddateees 21st century army
 oddateees message is the standard vision of a blade runner future
 but despite the corporations oppression of masses oddateee lives up to his
 nom de guerre by proclaiming himself an oddity whos as large as an
 aircraft carrier wow what a flat simile oddateee isnt exactly in saul
 williams league
 river blues features the droopy drawled vocal talent of jeb loy nichols the
 cut previously made an appearance on sincerely yours klein records most
 recent label compilation but failed to shine much amongst all that discs fluff
 here in its true context it is unsurprisingly not much better but at least
 the scratchadelic bridge makes some sort of sense after sensationals and oddateees
 raps still the surfers only exert themselves about as much as nicols losing
 steam after drudging up a heap of wornoutgroove fuzzhiss
 it takes the dancehall chat of dj collage and babylon tymes to get things
 bouncing out of complaisance while collage doesnt have the gruff fury of
 elephant man or the righteous zeal of sizzla his babylonvexing patter spurs
 sofa surfers into laying down a feisty echoabundant roller then comes the
 avantgarde illbience of twisted tongue serving as a nice transition between
 the routine of the discs first half to the more adventurous and successful
 second
 featuring the dynamic duo of techno animal and 2nd gen collaborator dlek
 elusive scripts bucks as formula should have dlek doesnt have to fake
 like sensational hes a thoroughly credible mc who doesnt rely on dopey bragging
 rhymes to proclaim his greatness he shows rather than tells with see the light
 junior delgado makes an irrefutable case for him to take over horace andys
 position in massive attack with talent like delgado sofa surfers have to come
 up with something special using massive attacks crawling version of john holts
 man next door as a model see the light is unmistakably this albums standout
 cut dawna lee comes on like a supersultry dawn penn thus making witness a
 knockout gorgeous rb ballad but in direct opposition to the beauty of witness
 the collaboration with expop group member and on u sound system affiliate mark
 stewart home truth is a hamfisted industrial dub rocker stewart it seems
 is never going to achieve the distinction of his 1990 electrodub masterpiece
 metatron and sofa surfers dont appear too keen on helping him better
 himself
encounters ends quite unexpectedly with the skipping skuzzedup marimba
 jaunt gamelan which recalls the ingenious playfulness klein records star
 artist seelenluft its almost as though seelenluft is an uncredited guest here
 gamelan makes the inescapable point that sofa surfers dont really need guests
 and collaborators to make unique and engaging music in fact encounters
 proves that more often than not the guests prevent the band from stretching
 themselves and hinder them from matching or exceeding their remarkable cargo
 and constructions go it alone next time boystrying to describe this stuff can be well trying i dont have much problem
 with the sounds some tambourine here sitar or some such eastern droner there
 but the general feeling is whats hard to translate descriptors like trance
 or drone dont really do vibracathedral orchestra justice not only because
 they carry too much baggage to really be useful but also because theyre too
 simple i cannot go into trance from most of this music its far too boisterous
 i hear drones in the mix but also about a hundred other things
 furthermore theres the issue over whether or not communal cathartic improvisation
 is something that can ever be translated what may seem transcendent in the moment
 could very well be unintelligible in the next that is if true transcendence could
 actually be communicated of course anything recorded could probably be classified
 as music today but there really isnt a working definition for the relationship
 between music and audience specifically regarding the intent of the composers
 and resulting receipt of their message
 leeds englands vibracathedral orchestra or vco may not give the message their
 audience takes from the music much thought rather as dabbling with gravity
 and who you are was made from several sessions of group improvisation in
 multiinstrumentalist michael flowers kitchen recorded directly to twotrack
 there may not have been much time for big concepts or even little ones another
 member bridget hayden offers more insight into their intent there is no chord
 formation that can be planned which creates elation or sadness or any art which
 is profound enough to change anything fundamental about a person there is just a
 resonance around us which musiciansartists are using or not using
 so whats left is continuous nonresolved or everresolved depending on your
 point of view trancedrone music though those terms still seem a bit off
 the mark the album begins with hypnotism of yr hips and from the getgo its
 clear that lulling you to sleep with smooth beats and ambient hissing will not be
 vcos game in fact much of their music appears to work best for jumping and
 flailing like a cromagnon man celebrating the new moon the repetitive rhythms
 seem influenced by indian ragas though maybe thats only because i can hear
 tablas tambouras and plenty of tambourine while a constant phased guitar pumps
 a fair amount of noise into the arrangement the song lasts about four minutes
 and segues without a break into let steam rule and luck lose here the guitar
 plays recognizable strumming figures and sometimes even lines resembling melodies
 up to this point vco has remained on the same chord throughout the record and
 theyll continue to do so occasionally cymbals crash while other times the
 tide ebbs into softer regions
 he play all day long distinguishes itself from the mass of sound by toning down
 the ambience introducing acoustic guitar warmth accompanied by sitarlike drone
 again the major chord from the beginning is held though youd be surprised at
 the textural variations they get from one tonality for me this is a highlight
 though i wouldnt blame you if you missed it somehow fingernail r n b
 removes most of the clutter to reveal quite standard to my ears indian mystic
 drones like what you might hear in a delhi mountaintop mosque at sunrise and
 just to show you that they have a sense of dynamics extended as they may be
 vco kicks out the jams on the epic the body is the arrow the arms form the bow
 lofi eastern minimalist terror abounds as a tambourine hacks away in the
 distance cutting through layers of odd strings low oddly tuned strings
 byzantine and who knows what other cultures lutes and a whole array of exotic
 percussion there are flutes too oh the flutes
 there arent many bands that play this kind of music that is with cds for sale
 the first incarnation of amon dl comes to mind but vco is louder and
 drastically more musically competent than they were colorados biota shares
 similarities with vco but is nearer the avantgarde end of the arttrance
 spectrum there arent many bad things to say about dabbling with gravity
 other than i probably wont play it everyday its not that i find it offensive
 or even boring which is a feat for trance music but rather droning just
 isnt an everyday thing for me if it is for you vco offer some interesting
 translationsbandnames are important the best ones are good indicators of where a band is
 coming from and what theyre trying to achieve or at the very least they sound
 good and work with the bands sound unfortunately not all bands can seem to
 find that one moniker thats perfect for them and a lot of them end up settling
 for some word that was lying around not being used for much else
 
 take elbow for instance thats a bleeding awful name for a band it doesnt
 even lend itself to much of a backstory what do you say to the interviewer when
 he asks how you chose your name oh well we always wanted to name the band for
 the bony joint where the upper arm meets the forearm even the various idioms
 the word appears in elbow room elbow grease cant help it out
 
 and then theres the questions it raises what does this band called elbow sound
 like what made them call themselves elbow are they good they dont sound
 very cool well friends its my good fortune to report to you that the bands
 music is a lot better than their name
 
 the english quintet open their debut at a medium tempo with any day now a song
 that immediately highlights a few of their strengths and also hints at a few of
 their weaknesses drummer jupp who apparently has just the one name lays down
 a slightly fractured snareheavy beat accompanied by a modicum of subtle
 programming and pete turners dubinfluenced bass lead vocalist guy garvey
 seems to have his voice on loan from peter gabriel though he keeps his delivery
 hushed and rather lowkey the entire band harmonizes impressively with him on
 the choruses making for a dense texture especially when combined with craig
 potters organ lines
 
 garveys gabriel resemblance gradually melts away as the rest of the album unfolds
 though he occasionally returns to it when he goes for the big held notes that
 punctuate the climaxes of songs like cant stop and the excellent closer
 scattered black and whites red also retains some of gabriels influence
 with its deceptively complex drum and percussion parts and heaving cello
 garveys refrain of this cant go on is one of the albums best melodic moments
 as the songs mix dismantles itself at the conclusion the main elements exit
 first leaving behind a heavily delayed and tremoloed guitar part that you hardly
 even noticed was there during the song
 
 mark potter dumps delaydrenched guitars all over a creeping programmed drumbeat
 on little beast which finds garvey sitting a little further from the front of
 the mix instead subsumed by the atmospheric music created by his bandmates it
 takes a bit too long to get to the next song though and the track isnt really
 interesting enough to warrant all of its four minutes by the time powder blue
 finally does roll around asleep in the backs biggest flaw starts to come
 into focus
 
 the song is actually pretty good taken on its own with garvey hitting a good
 falsetto on the refrain and the boys providing him with some fine backing vocals
 but the entire album falls within a very narrow and very slow tempo range
 powder blue works well in that range with its floating piano ostinatos and
 light spattering of sax but these guys really need a fast song to insert
 somewhere in the running order for the sake of diversity
 
 the closest they come is bitten by the tailfly another strong track its not
 exactly fast but its feel is considerably different from what surrounds it
 mark potters guitar kicks up actual dust for the first time on the album and
 the fauxtribal beats and curiously tense verses lend the song a sort of neurotic
 pulse that draws you in the dynamic shifts between the verses and potters
 deafening guitar interjections are almost enough to keep it interesting on their
 own but thankfully the whole song proves engaging
 
 the band is always discriminating with their arrangements occasionally utilizing
 analog synths to color in the edges of a passage and using extra musicians to
 fill in the texture where its obvious that the bands own instruments wouldnt
 quite be enough the best example of this is the woodwind quintet that shows up
 on the records title cut at first the cor anglais and clarinet enter with
 long held notes almost blending with the organ but by the songs end the whole
 quintet has joined offering up countermelodies and some needed timbrel variety
 
 while the band has a very developed sense of texture and sound though they rather
 desperately need to work on changing things up a bit more with regard to the songs
 themselves as i said before the whole album comes in at roughly the same tempo
 and though theyre able to make a sevenminute epic like newborn interesting all
 the way through by shifting the texture almost constantly simply shifting textures
 a lot doesnt offer the kind of variety i need to sustain me over the course an
 entire album
 
 elbow have managed to craft a skilled and laudable debut asleep in the back
 finds them starting their recording career theyve been a live unit for almost
 ten years now at a level a lot of bands dont even reach on their third or fourth
 albums if they manage to harness their strengths and inject just a bit more
 variety into the mix i have a feeling a second album from elbow could really
 deliveryoure not a folk singer bob dylan accused phil ochs youre a journalist he
 echoed the most consistent criticism of the late phil ochs who made his name with
 topical folk songs ochs churned out political lyrics taking ideas from the news
 and from firsthand experience with the turmoil of the 1960s a coal miners
 strike in kentucky the fight for civil rights in mississippi and antiwar
 rallies some of which he helped organize his sharp lyrics and refusal to
 compromise combined with an easy humor and winning personality to make him one of
 the great protest singers but ochs was also ambitious hed watched his peers
 cross over to stardom peter paul and mary joan baez and his friend from
 greenwich village dylan by the midsixties ochs was afraid hed be left behind
 
 this new best of collection gathers twelve songs from ochs last four studio
 albums hed switched labels from elektra to am and began to write complicated
 pop songs that moved away from the news but he still didnt hit it big and as
 he stagnated professionally nixons election and the continuing vietnam war wore
 him down the frustration and depression that permeate these songs make this a
 grim record of the end of his career
the best of phil ochs 20th century masters begins with over half of the
 songs from ochs 1967 masterpiece pleasures of the harbor ochs had been
 listening to the beach boys pet sounds and the beatles sgt peppers
 and was aiming for something just as big ditching strict topical songs he
 explored the state of the nation in lyrics about cocktail parties elderly flower
 ladies and sailors back from sea he left his guitar behind and brought in one
 of liza minnellis arrangers ian freebairnsmith to write orchestration
pleasures of the harbor actually sounds conservative for its time ochs
 still wrote lyrics like a journalist his florid descriptions still took in
 detailed scenes and translated them to song the music borrowed oldfashioned
 styles for example the swelling strings on pleasures of the harbor the
 neoclassical flower lady and the ragtime piano on outside of a small circle
 of friends but pleasures of the harbor was a masterful pop album
 ochs voice is limited with his narrow range and slight twang he was no tony
 bennett but its stark against the baroque arrangements and the sincerity
 makes songs like flower lady honestly beautiful cross my heart starts as a
 dainty pop song but ochs words make it compelling the despair and hopelessness
 of the verses and the conviction with which he turns it around in the chorus
 outside of a small circle of friends a satire of liberal apathy and laziness
 set to a ragtime tune surpasses even draft dodger rag as ochs most scathingly
 humorous song
 
 on the other hand the crucifixion was inspired by the assassination of john f
 kennedy and it asks what drives society to kill its best and youngest leaders
 its the pinnacle of ochs songwriting though its music is a bit awkward ochs
 hired experimental musician joseph byrd to arrange it with disturbing strings and
 bizarre electronic sounds with mixed results many people eventually including
 ochs himself regretted the weird mess that byrd made of the arrangement but
 its strangely appropriate to the theme when i first listened to this years ago
 it was the scariest thing id ever heard
pleasures of the harbor proved the breadth of ochs talent but it didnt
 help him commercially it outsold his earlier albums but only reached 168 on
 the billboard charts unfortunately this was ochs creative and commercial
 peak on his next three albums he adjusted the formula by stripping down the
 instrumentation and bringing back explicit political lyrics he never found a
 combination that worked commercially and his frustration with everything from
 his career to the political scene creeps into the rest of these songs
 
 the lyrics of tape from california mix political statements and surreal imagery
 and the song features a contemporary band with electric piano and drums ochs
 wrote the war is over for a rally that he helped organize its marching band
 backdrop is interesting but the song isnt as strong without its context
 william butler yeats visits lincoln park and escapes unscathed on the other
 hand hauntingly reflects ochs experience at the 68 chicago convention it
 appeared along with the mournful rehearsals for retirement on an album whose
 cover bore a fictional tombstone phil ochs died chicago illinois 1968
 
 chords of fame and no more songs come from ochs last studio record the
 humorously titled phil ochs greatest hits produced by van dyke parks
 the songs tried a countrywestern sound as a last ditch plea for popularity
 this collection ends with an upbeat live version of his signature tune i aint
 marchin anymore but in reality ochs career was over writers block heavy
 drinking and mental illness ended his songwriting and drove him to take his own
 life in 1976 at age 35
 
 in his biography of ochs michael schumaker recounts how he worried that his songs
 would be forgotten he has yet to be seriously rediscovered and this generically
 titled collection probably wont change that though it is a good and affordable
 starting point for new fans as andy whitaker said of him his persona was the
 work of art no matter how well the music stands on its own it works better
 with an understanding of the time and of the man which can be said of our other
 great journalists activists and folk singers like them phil ochs gives us our
 historynorways are mokkelbost plays the real dark stuff he draws the strange intricate
 scary pictures and i can only imagine that he dreams of dank pits and lovecraftian
 orcs his cpu is probably filling in a lot of the details because most folks
 simply dont have the threshold for goth to withstand such hopelessly downward
 spiraling expression and while i have no insight into this guys personal life
 its probably a safe bet to say hes a got a shelfload of spell books and ghost
 stories with which to inspire a gross manner of midnight brainstorming sessions
 and shameful graveyard confessionals
 
 but then again thats pretty unlikely it could just be that mokkelbost
 recording here as single unit has a knack for nipping the sounds of the
 apocalypse in the bud certainly he knows a thing or two about the technique
 taking fairly straightahead industrial algorithms reznor may be a reference
 but something tells me he doesnt want to fuck you like an animal so much as
 merely puncture your eardrums and spicing up the mixremix with your workaday
 thrash guitar and avantprogressive dynamics and this is something he excels
 at
 
 whether or not i follow his steps into the black forest mostly depends on my mood
 because it doesnt appear hes likely to change his tune anytime soon chiefly
 if you want the real spooky stuff single unit has you covered likewise if you
 just want a little sour to spoil your sweet life mokkelbost can help you out
 otherwise fall in line to get pummeled and i suggest leaving the bathroom
 lights on if dark isnt your thing
 
 single units debut fulllength family of forces begins with the very
 brief and prophetic moving caves enter abstract distant sireny sounds
 close in like a spaceship landing and soon enough the aggroguitar pounces
 down center stage like a bull in a maternity ward the percussion matches the
 crunch strikeforstrike and the only things that dont remind me of an electronic
 zeni geva are the tinkerbells entering at suitably inappropriate moments
 
 5th cumming hopefully accidental pun notwithstanding is a rather nice
 blueprint for most of the rest of the album theres a pseudorepeating figure
 wherein mokkelbosts big guitar lays down the distortion and drang while drum
 machines pound out death metal beats and red alarm synths play like the 80s were
 only ever supposed to be good for mad max and eminent nuclear war maybe paranoia
 is a good adjective for this album because i keep having the feeling things are
 about to take a turn for the worse as each layer of noise and programmed chaos
 gets tossed onto the heap at just over five minutes this is one of the longest
 tunes on the album and it feels like a week
 
 p pp intro and passion pirates and parasites are something of a miniepic
 and they do make use of dynamics and something like pacing though its brisk
 whenever possible the former begins like an anthem for desensitization with
 persistently discordant keyboard mashing and what sounds like a manic church
 organ this is juxtaposed with brief sections of calm as if this is a tale of
 two different worlds and much of this album could be described as cinematic
 even if future shock and gore is the theatre du jour the latter tune
 feels very much like a hard prog tune but played on the beloved sequencers and
 scarred strat rather than with a bunch of exconservatory subversives named jarno
 and helmut again theres a feel here of doom and heavy combat and the actual
 playing is never less than inhumanly precise so if you need a breather or even
 just a volume adjustment please feel free
 
 the minority mode on family of forces is carnivalesque and im of course
 not referring to happy clowns and cotton candy houses of mirrors are more likely
 the domains of tunes like fluktrute and orgel alene both of which emphasize
 devilish whimsy over sheer sonic bombardment some of this might conceivably be
 mistaken for a recent danny elfman soundtrack if only he hung out with darren
 aronofsky more than tim burton postmodern creaking door music i wont go
 that far
 
 almost inevitably this kind of record makes me a tad numb after a while without
 creeping into mokkelbosts psyche i couldnt tell you if that was the plan all
 along though with as much detail as went into the rhythm tracks alone i doubt
 it the only downfall with making music for the end of civilization is that you
 run the risk of alienating your relatively civil listeners dont get me wrong
 im all for a good digital maelstrom but if i take a short intermission please
 understandgenerally speaking collaboration is a good thing when musicians share ideas not
 only do they get to take advantage of the very best that each of them has to offer
 but the added perspective generally prevents them from falling into blind
 selfobsessed egotism generally speaking stephin merritt of the magnetic fields
 the gothic archies and the future bible heroes is one of those rare wonderful
 musicians whos at his best when hes unapologetically being himself but it wasnt
 until the release of the brilliantly executed 69 love songs on which
 merritt opened himself up to the contributions of his touring band and guest
 vocalists that his unique musical vision was fully realized
 
 and merritt is without question a true original a character falling somewhere
 between cole porter and droopy whos as likely to cite abba as a musical influence
 as he is to bring up harry partch over the course of his career merritt has
 proven that hes one of the most adept versatile songwriters working today
 capable of cranking out synthpop gems and downcast piano ballads alike all
 dripping with a unique kind of theatrical semisatirical melancholy
 
 while many artists struggle to create something that buries its influences under
 the guise of innovation merritts strength has always rested partially in the
 limits he imposes on himself while trying to incorporate such a wide range of
 influences could result in an utter mess trying to incorporate these influences
 into say a threeminute pop song with a ukulele yields much more contained
 interesting results
 
 this the soundtrack to the independent film eban and charley is the first
 thing to be recorded by merritt under his birthname and appropriately its in
 some ways the loosest most unfiltered thing merritt has ever recorded working
 outside of the framework of the pop song merritt is left to explore more exotic
 sound sources and song structures unfortunately without that framework these
 elements often fail to amount to anything significant providing somewhat
 interesting meandering background music but little more
eban and charleys 40second pianoonly introductory piece mother seems
 promising enough simple stark and vaguely melodic the greatest strength of
 mother lies in its brevity sadly the same cant be said for the plodding
 cricket problem a sound collage of bicycles slurping straws and music box
 chimes that fails both as a proper song and as an abstract piece of mechanical
 music
 
 things pick up with some summer day one of the few songs on eban and charley
 to play host to merritts haunting baritone whimsical and melancholy without
 being too heavyhanded the track is a lovely albeit brief glimpse of merritt
 doing what he does best still the albums finest moments dont come until
 poppyland and maria maria maria the most fully developed songs on the record
 and two songs that could easily hold their own against the magnetic fields better
 work the former harkens back to merritts older work with a charming drum
 machine beat and bubbly synthesizers maria maria maria is simply gorgeous a
 dark reverbsoaked slab of despondency with a lyrical combination of absurdism
 and sincerity that could only have come from merritt
 
 but elsewhere the musical accompaniment for eban and charley cant seem to
 figure out exactly what it wants to do with itself tracks like titles consist
 of little more than arranged mechanical noises that dont benefit from the kind
 of grand conceptualism that made composers like ligetis mechanical music so
 fascinating
 
 for fans harboring high expectations for merritts work eban and charley
 is more than a little bittersweet its high points are merritt at his best but
 substantial portions of it seem somewhat like aimless background music collaboration
 is indeed good thing but the general unevenness of this record suggests that
 merritt does his best work when the parameters of his music are established by
 his own mind not an independent filmphdruss conducive guide to quality chapter 26 quality vs talent
 in the preceding chapters we established that quality is a very tangible
 attribute which has been the cornerstone of social progress since mans
 inception unfortunately the infinitely confounding nature of quality has made
 the process of defining it a long and fruitless one in short what the hell is
 quality we know from previous excursions that a teacher grading written tests
 has to employ his conception of quality in order to differentiate between an
 extremely good essay and one thats relatively mediocre of course theres
 always the collegiate preoccupation with correct spelling correct punctuation
 etc but once semanticcorrectness is out of the way the only thing that
 earmarks a truly good paper is the quality of the work therein
 so what is this quality comprised of talent well talent is occasionally a
 symptomatic characteristic but to assume that the two go hand in hand completely
 ignores the dj zeph principle this is a hard law to explain so ill refer you
 to a recent socratic dialectic i had with one of my students
 student hey prof i just dropped by to tell you that that dj zeph shit you
 played during class wasnt too shabby whyd you come down so hard on the guy
 hes not really a bad musician
 pirsig i see you didnt get the point of the lesson hows a little private
 tutoring sound
disc begins
 pirsig alright notice how this first song percussion discussion draws so
 heavily from world beat the marimbas and tablas are reminiscent of the seductive
 rhythms of laikas silver apples of the moon albeit awkwardly handled
 too unwieldy for lesssensitive male hands it seems the flourishes of guitar
 and live sitar are nice enough but rather than creating a truly interesting
 dynamic they merely pad out the track nothing horrible but nothing to really
 pique your interest yet
 student but man thats totally one of the best tracks on the album
 pirsig my point exactly percussion discussion finds zeph barely dipping his
 toe into foreign waters before rushing back to the patio to drape himself in
 urban america circa 1982 this is oldschool pastiche hiphop right down to
 the james brown samples theres even a battlerap anthem boasting the unsubtle
 title rubber and glue which features underground neerdowell azeem spreading
 the good word about his sneakers but ultimately zeph never enters the creative
 stratum of his influences which sounds to be grandmaster flash bsides his
 scratching is pretty solid but its a technique with limited variation
 student but man that takes talent
 pirsig well eddie van halen is a pretty talented guitarist but how often do
 you listen to ou812
 student dude im so disillusioned
 as you can see the subject one dj zeph has enough talent to draw comparisons
 to his musical heroes but fails to invoke the same sense of excitement those same
 artists did twentyyears ago when their sound was considered groundbreaking
 thusly a talented individual doesnt necessitate a quality product obviously
 this situation could be easily remedied can you guess which aspect of the pirsig
 equation for artistryxae zeph is lacking
 talent innovation qualitybefore tuesday weld became trivia game fodder she was the disarmingly cute female
 lead of such 50s and 60s trashcinema throwaways as rock rock rock and
 sex kittens go to college nature takes its course though starlets grow
 old beauty fades and cuteness wilts and well now tuesday weld is just an
 obscure bandname albeit one with an ironic qualifying prefix the real is
 tacked onto the front end
 the real tuesday weld is nothing more than london native stephen coates a
 recent art school dropout and huge serge gainsbourg fan hes also a hopeless
 nostalgic obsessed with 1930s jazz and other ancient recordings in a quixotic
 attempt to recapture the wafting and ephemeral quality of the prohibitionday
 records he was exposed to in his youth coates has tacked big band samples onto
 electronic beats and backgrounds laying down breathy vocals and glib lyrics over
 the hybrid and in the end where psyche meets cupid is a 15track concept
 album of stuff that surprisingly doesnt suck
 the opener am i in love asks the question am i in love with my love or
 myself over a musical amalgam both eerie and cheesy of a crackly submerged
 bigband horn samples and 70s electric piano tinkling the result simultaneously
 reminds me of foghorn leghorn the ballroom scene from the shining and
 the andrew sisters boogie woogie bugle boy from company b
 i love the train takes the same basic musical material but brings a canned
 dance beat to the fore resulting in something acutely contrived yet catchy
 and effective elsewhere at the house of the clerkenwell kid is an instrumental
 track that i wouldnt have known was a studio pastiche if it wasnt on this
 record and the charmingly titled terminally ambivalent over you combines an
 ascending ukulele chord progression with a sexedout rhodes keyboard annoying
 fauxscratch turntable sounds mar the composition ever so slightly
 the birds and the bees is one of the albums better tracks coming off like a
 brazilian rendition at half speed of some john barry score that never found its
 way into a bond film dj vu playing on the haventweheardthisbefore theme
 that is the bedrock of coates playful genrebastardizing is short and sweet and
 like the sensation itself quickly forgotten
where psyche meets cupid is best listened to in its entirety taken
 individually the tracks are as likely to make you raise your eyebrows in disdain
 as they are to pique your interest its as a whole that the album is actually
 somewhat affecting the sequencing is superb and theres a weird elegance and
 smoothness to the compositions that almost neutralizes the inherent silliness of
 combining gatsbyera record loops with 21st century keyboard beats oh and i
 promise i will never mention foghorn leghorn in a record review ever again everfor a moment back in 1998 beth hirsch could have had it all her astonishing
 and immediately moving vocals made human the endearingly plodding anachronisms of
 airs moon safari had she released an album of songs as lush as all i
 need and you make it easy hirsch would have been bigger than dido three
 years later titles and idols trots along and im a little upset not
 as upset as i was when i heard hirschs rummagesale cashin of a debut 2000s
 early days but upset nonetheless
 
 hirsch and her collaborators have clearly worked hard on titles and idols
 not a note out of place not a beat out of sync not a lament out of earnestness
 this is an electronically upgraded preciously beautiful coffeeshop poetess album
 its honesty and integrity are too longfaced for me paying close attention to
 the guileless titles and idols makes me fantasize about hirsch performing
 the vocals to airs blowjob panegyric wonder milky bitch perhaps im asking
 her to be a little superfreaky and its her right to say no but fifty minutes
 of humorless observations about relationships out of whack and illstarrd
 attempts at happiness get me hungry for some shameless grot
 
 diving straight into territory identical to everything but the girls
 temperamental hirsch swoons and graciously moans through the beatless
 mix of let it live thick synth pads and a wisp of a pedal steel guitar
 accentuate hirschs gorgeous voice i know why is the first of four songs on
 this album featuring black dog aka ken downie as producer and surprisingly
 downie doesnt smother hirsch in techno instead sending rhythms skittering
 across hirschs facsimile cloudsperiod joni mitchellisms avoiding the
 thumping assault weapon production of kosheens hide u downie finds a balance
 between his technology and hirschs voice
 
 on the title track production custom blue doesnt match downies delicacy
 nonetheless the big drums and furrowing bass compliment hirschs defiant
 delivery the partially spoken word captain daylight is as coffeeshop as
 titles and idols gets with a distant squeeze box lending a sea shanty
 vibe to the already briny waltz nest sensation is unmistakably a black dog
 production it bounces like an early warp bleep release but remains sympathetic
 to hirschs alternately delicate and feisty statements of identity still i
 cant escape imagining that hirsch is hinting at a desire to be alanis morissette
 here ken downie keeps hirsch within the bounds of decency by directing her back
 to the joni mitchell school of skipping annunciation for the happygolucky
 until i met you producer jackson from paris steps up for one cut the
 ukuleleglitched story song nigel and fiona but like custom blue and black dog
 he doesnt allow the production to overwhelm the singer
titles and idols finishes with the albums most glaring error custom
 blues radical mix of the opener let it live i think custom blue wanted to
 turn hirsch into a diva ready to take on vocal duties for a moshpitready
 successor to massive attacks mezzanine having signaled a blasttocome
 with distorted broken guitar chords the producer doesnt have the courage
 of his convictions to force the mix into an outandout rocker until halfway
 through at that point hirsch cant compete and is left to ululate and to
 vocalize as the riffs swirl about her like a dervish bikergang
 
 though lyrically ponderous and humorless titles and idols is far from
 being an unpleasant listen i have no doubts about the effectiveness and the
 beauty of hirschs voice nor her producers sensitivity to her material but
 what gets to me is that hirsch and her producers dont really let rip with
 exception of the failed last track titles and idols is awfully polite
 breakbeaters lamb walk in similar territory and avoid sounding prim of course
 this record errs on the side of caution and that should serve the album very well
 commercially still from an artistic standpoint i cant really consider it
 an object of venerationthere are thousands of them out there the people who toil away the hours by
 setting up mics in the hallway bouncing track after track of sound on their
 fourtracks ensuring that independent music can never die on one hand its
 very easy to romanticize this kind of thing musicians who do their work with no
 guarantee of ever being heard are sort of like monks practicing their arts far
 away from civilization completely at odds with what the material world would
 have them accomplish how noble to stick so closely to their ideals that they
 would work so hard for no apparent reward other than hearing the sounds in their
 heads played back
 
 on the other hand theoretically anyone can do this go pick up a recorder and
 sing and play and bounce to your hearts content as milhouse said fun is fun
 but some of us have to listen to the stuff too it would be nice if everyone
 who was taping themselves made good music but often and i can personally attest
 to this the music is like an inside joke only understood by the teller and
 perhaps a few of his best friends
 
 of course sometimes people are forced into this method due to circumstances in
 other words if you dont have the cash or label support to record in a big fancy
 studio how else to make music but by recording at your house or garage in a
 perfect world the music god would automatically give the most visionary musicians
 record contracts but as it is the kids will have to make do with what they have
 i imagine canadas greg watson is one of these types masterfully producing his
 own stuff because nobody else will
 
 watsons virtual oneman show the orange alabaster mushroom plays amazingly
 wellcrafted psychedelic pop generally from the british angle he started
 recording in 1991 under this moniker after working with a band called the 14th
 wray his first music was actually issued under their name despite being almost
 entirely written and recorded by watson he did eventually end up recording in a
 proper studio in the late 90s though the results retained his diy aesthetic and
 only emphasized how spoton his psych arrangements were
 
 as for the music id say the dukes of stratosphear have nothing on this guy i
 dont generally go out of my way to listen to anything that resembles a genre
 exercise but the orange alabaster mushroom is so amazingly precise in its
 depiction of 6667 era british psychedelia im drawn into the stuff by its
 sheer persistence and to top it off these are very good tunes whats the
 value in copying anything verbatim watsons music would sit well on a shelf
 next to nuggets and thats the best compliment i can give this release
space time a compendium of the orange alabaster mushroom is a compilation
 of material released from 1991 through 1998 watson recorded most of it on
 fourtrack but a few tracks as mentioned earlier were done on eighttrack in a
 studio your face is in my mind is actually one of the few americanflavored
 tracks recalling bands like the seeds or and the mysterions with raging
 farfisa organ and raucous garagegrunge guitar the opening organ exposition
 which actually reminds me of iron butterfly more than anyone else is alone worth
 the price of admission and check this your face has left impressions deep
 inside my cranium and when those thoughts are realized its here i find that
 your face is in my mind thats a lyric my friend which watson delivers with
 whiny crass sincerity
 
 no great psychedelic band could exist without its own title song watsons
 we are the orange alabaster mushroom fits the bill here and is prime small
 faces circa ogdens nut gone flake with its anthemic chorus and
 aggressive drumming sunny day is a tart slice of musichall while tree
 pie gets by on sheer aggression and hyped up soul power courtesy of harmony
 vocals in overdrive and a guitar solo so of a different era that i wonder if the
 seeds jan savage wasnt beamed in for the occasion by the way jan where are
 you
 
 other tunes take the softer approach another place features a rather beautiful
 guitar line and telling lines like i dont belong here though there is another
 place i can go watsons vocals are still in trebly whiny mode yet he manages
 to bring out some inherent sweetness in this music another charmer is valerie
 vanillaroma featuring nice byrdsy twelvestring guitar and relatively smooth
 harmony vocals the bridges guitar and organ hits are classic and if theres a
 fourth austin powers movie as if i had a doubt they need to get watson to
 write the love theme
 
 if psychedelic isnt your thing then obviously this album isnt for you
 furthermore if hearing vinyl ticks on a cd this collection is a rerelease of
 a vinyl set from 1999 and they apparently just took the old records and
 transferred them to compact disc then you might get annoyed with this
 however you can only dog on addictively catchy well made psychpop for so
 long before giving in to the groovy sounds no this record isnt a major
 statement but it is almost flawlessly executed chalk one up to the bedroom
 musician for keeping this music alivei have yet to be fully convinced of the relevance of the dj mix are they good
 at parties sure are they entertaining on occasion do you listen to them
 over and over until you have every synth splash and subtle nuance memorized
 ahh theres the problem whether theyre comprised of funk moroccan trance
 ibiza disco or some insidious blend of the three theyre usually going to find
 their way into the sell pile eventually heres why
 1 the athomelistening problem i admire a good djs ability to get me shakin
 that ass on the dancefloor but oftentimes that doesnt make for an engaging
 experience when im commutin that ass from dc to baltimore in the morning rare
 is the mix ive found that can hold up without the usual fog machine and strobe
 light accompaniment
 2 the novelty wearoff the first time through most dj mixes usually turn up a
 bunch of surprises along the lines of dude i cant believe he just segued saul
 williams into sonic youth but too often when the shock of an inventive pairing
 fades so too does the charm
 3 the wank factor defined as the prioritization of technique over content a
 dj making wikkity wikkity wik noises for an hour is about as entertaining as a
 guitarist going deedily deedily deedily for an hour were all impressed by
 their amazing dexterity sure but isnt there anything else these guys can do
 that being said last year i discovered a mix that successfully avoided all three
 of the above pitfalls the muchadmired widelybootlegged brainfreeze a
 collaboration between icon dj shadow and jurassic 5 turntablist cut chemist
 brainfreeze was a onehour throwdown comprised largely of rare funk and
 soul 45s based around neglected classics like the funky dj the tramp from
 funky broadway and most famously 711s doin the slurp jingle the two kept
 the overt dj trickery to a minimum and sculpted a mixtape symphony that withstood
 repeated listens
product placement the duos latest collaboration is being hyped as the
 sequel to brainfreeze with a similar mission all rare 45s format two
 tracks one hour and release extremely limited unfortunately this sequel
 status will invariably lead to lazy critics comparing the new release to its cult
 classic predecessor lazy critics like me its not as good and doesnt skirt
 the above pet peeves quite as nimbly
 the albums first track gets off to a slow and clichd start with the standard
 selfreferential samples and exhibitions of scratching speed oddly the first
 recognizable song used is led zeppelins whole lotta love which would seem to
 indicate a different musical direction for the ensuing hour is there any man
 less funky than jimmy page but quickly the piece settles down into a more
 soulful chill pace constructed from a rapidfire series of laidback instrumental
 segments so the seamless blending demonstrated on brainfreeze remains
 intact but with source material that comes across as considerably less energetic
 and gritty
 complaint 2 is dangerously courted by the first tracks centerpiece cookin
 with gas a natural gas promotional tune featuring teenagers giving the most
 awful rapping performances imaginable while the humor of the song and the djs
 juvenile interweaving of yes fart noises rapidly wears off shadow and cut
 chemist place it over a sparse oldschool beat that provides a solid foundation
 for the middle ten minutes of the piece soon enough though the mix returns
 to a slow funky strut that while enjoyable doesnt provide much in the way of
 memorable moments
 lest you think im unfairly comparing product placement to its predecessor
 the second half of the disc begins with five minutes of reworked brainfreeze
 staples like california soul and id be nowhere today using different
 versions or segments of their previous records 45s these tracks no doubt brought
 huge cheers when the set was played on their late 2001 minitour unfortunately
 it comes across here as sour and cloying
 the following sections utilize a variety of commercial jingles hence the title
 and novelty tunes espousing the virtues of soft drinks milk motocross and more
 obviously attempts to recreate the popular doin the slurp sequence from
 brainfreeze the results vary from successful a folkandbrass solder
 job on the real thing to near unlistenable revving motorcycle noises are
 unsurprisingly sort of hard on the ear in any context
 by remining the same territory of their previous mutual effort with less
 compelling material product placement falls into a trap familiar to
 sequels of another genre film it would be overly harsh to say dj shadow and
 cut chemist have produced their staying alive here but in the end the
 album is no more satisfying a followup than say jaws 2 its a damn
 shame had it been an empire strikes back this reviewer might have been
 that much closer to seeing the dj lightolympias new strange attractors audio house is off to a great start the labels
 third release was last years underlooked oceanless by landing a swirling
 maelstrom of harsh feedback and delicate guitar melody that was a worthy addition
 to the dronerock canon now strange attractors has followed the landing release
 with this equally fine debut record by surface of eceon a unit composed of three
 members from landing and guitaristvocalist adam forkner of yume bitsu
 as one would expect from a band made up of xbe of an existing group surface of
 eceon shares many qualities with landing though vocals play a slightly larger
 role here two songs have complete verses if no choruses the longish pieces
 are still mainly epic guitar instrumentals laced with impressionistic percussion
 analog synth drones and every conceivable kind of effects unit and though this
 album is stuffed with psychedelicdreamdrone ear candy the sound coating would
 mean little if the band were not so accomplished melodically
 the open sea opens the album and immediately reveals a kinship to landing and
 yume bitsu a chiming guitar sketches out the chords as the song gains momentum
 an almost unnervingly clear voice sings a spare melody revealing surface of
 eceons songoriented bent but the voice disappears as the guitars fall in and
 the chord changes become movements between massive walls of sound classic
 shoegazers like lush are an obvious reference point but the structure of the
 melody and the quality of the voice remind me of low with an explosive psychedelic
 backdrop
 silence beheads us is a beautifully paced track of fertile dripping wet drone
 tentative feedback gurgles set a placid mood that never leaves though frayed
 seams of distortion weave in and out as the track progresses fans of windy and
 carl looking for something looser with a slightly more prickly edge take note
 the grasshopper king is the rockingist track with a bouncy rhythm and the
 king beneath the mountains lone riff a happy guitar pattern overflowing
 with feedback and joy
 the jamout nature of the grasshopper king is true to the surface of eceon
 aesthetic as most of these tracks were birthed from lengthy improvisations
 unfortunately the jam aesthetic betrays surface of eceon on one occasion the
 sloppy and poorly recorded council of the locusts though this track boasts an
 impressive cache of dark energy the guitars meander aimlessly and never congeal
 the band does redeem themselves however on the 16minute closer ascension to
 the second tier of the outer plane of dryystn ecyeon uh so yeah there may
 have been some drugs taken somewhere along the way here much of which is
 gorgeous ambient guitar work in the frippeno vein altogether the king
 beneath the mountain is a riveting collection of textured guitar noiseinstrumentals literally dont say anything they can express almost anything but
 they can also give a crutch to someone who has nothing to talk about lately
 weve also gotten film music instrumentals that bands write for a movie often
 an obscure one or that were written in a form that sounds like a narrative in
 other words its music that was made for a film that you will never see records
 like this all ten of john zorns filmworks discs come to mind have
 builtin crutches because the listener already knows something will be missing
 we have to trust the band that the sex scene gun fight or television commercial
 looks as cool as the theme music
 the british fourpiece electrelane play almost nothing but instrumentals on their
 debut rock it to the moon the album sounds cinematic and yet its
 definitely more than just background music take the second track long dark
 which opens slowly with a throbbing bass and the sound of mia clarke scraping her
 guitar strings the tension builds as clarke kicks off a peter gunn guitar line
 and verity susman pulls up with her stabbing needletoned farfisa they tear it
 up for a couple of minutes switch to a slow part and then rip it up again ten
 minutes three segues all rock
 theres only one problem all of the songs sound like that the tunes shift
 exclusively between fast and slow and they have so many transitions that
 playing the whole record is like watching eleven car chases in a row even if
 theres a narrative the song titles dont help us find it one song for example
 is simply called film music the two songs with lyrics are concise and rachel
 dalleys whale songlike bass both relaxes as well as compels but the album runs
 for over an hour and much of the wind is sucked out by the time they hit mother
 the most knucklesplitting piece on the album
 in small doses however its terrific theres no doubt electrelane could beat
 up everybody in godspeed you black emperor mike pattons fantmas may get in
 and out quickly and tortoise may have nice textures but they cant match
 electrelane for volume without solos hooks or blatant virtuosity they kick
 out music that flares overhead like rockets and flaming school buses and that
 may be why rock it to the moon seems deficient it doesnt take an hour
 for them to make their point
 the first time i heard them i wondered if electrelane play movies when theyre on
 stage as it turns out last summer they arranged their set around films by
 jeanluc godard maybe if they can get godard to contribute lyrics next time out
 theyll have a bigger winnermy initial thought was that with point cornelius had made an album not
 of songs but of machines twittering little trinkets and gewgaws clockwork
 formalist tricks hooks and grooves tiny snazzy robots covered with pushbuttons
 and blinking lights i was mostly wrong about this but back when i didnt know
 that i was all set to talk about corneliuss other half takako minekawa and
 more importantly her collaborators in dymaxion who are by my estimation past
 masters of the sonic trinketry the clever formalist motorik grooves and the
 whole concept of songs as basically rube goldberg devices these things where
 you watch tab a snap ingeniously and unexpectedly into slot b and then watch the
 whole machine teeter back and forth the trick is that while everyone was trying
 to meld rock genres and dance genres by throwing blippy textures and drum loops
 under crunchy guitars some people decided to use the tools of rock but organize
 them using the structures of dance or idm
point isnt really as like that as i thought but lets pretend just for
 a second that it is you couldnt possibly ask for anyone to do that stuff
 better than cornelius does like him or not hes pretty much the master of this
 sort of thing evidence is littered from his lateperiod albums with flippers
 guitar to solo records like 9669 to tracks like mic check and magoo
 opening from fantasma his more proper songoriented us breakthrough
 evidence is abundant on point as well one need look no further than the
 moment where bird watching at inner forest a sweet jaunty samba suddenly and
 masterfully disintegrates into i hate hate a whirlwind of slicedanddiced
 cartoon prog that sounds like aphex twin making mincemeat of a track by the
 fucking champs if youre going to talk about someone who can produce someone
 who can slap together shimmery organic instruments with the same agility as the
 worlds best glitchmeisters and laptop guys cornelius really should be mentioned
 and hes gotten a lot better at this than he was on fantasma a record that
 in retrospect sounds a little too eager to please all the tinny busy layering
 and the nearconstant bells and whistles now look a little like a hyperactive
 fourthgrader given free reign at the school talent show point backs off
 its more efficient and thus more minimal cornelius has learned where a couple
 instruments and a couple tricks can do the work of ten of each its also a lot
 smoother and more languid the bulk of it actually qualifies to be called
 subdued the cleverness technical mastery and pingpong stereo effects are
 all there in spades but this time theyre all much more mellow than youd think
 listen right and youll hardly notice them because youll be wrapped up by the
 thing i initially completely missed some of these tracks are just plain lovely
 as songs
 thats right you could very satisfyingly listen to point while casting
 cornelius as some kind of modernday esquivel a master of arrangement and studio
 technologically and virtually everything that makes you cup your hands over your
 headphones and be just plain wowed by the stuff thats coming out of them but
 the thing is that point like the idm records it shares some of its
 formalist leanings with gradually reveals itself to contain some song forms that
 are without qualification quite beautiful and expressive and in completely
 nontrinkety ways it sounds as if hes been listening to more bossa nova subtle
 acoustic guitar rhythms are all over this record it sounds as if hes made a
 conscious effort to turn his vocal harmonies from chirpy amazements to swooning
 dreamy softtouches it sounds as if hes basically loosened up and figured out
 where subtly funky flows and immersive bubbly drifts are way more agreeable than
 hyperactive flashes and nonstop banging he has in many senses mellowed out
 and theres whats good about point cornelius comes across as some sort
 of berhipster from the glossy fashion mags a cultural curator a buzzy japanese
 pastiche guy making music that feels like bandai pocket games ive no doubt that
 a lot of you will hear point somewhere and be turned off by precisely this
 quality and ill admit that before throwing point on i sort of feared that
 it might be just another totally mid90s reiteration of that heavily explored
 model but point isnt all about playing with trinkets and baubles point
 of view point develops from an airy bounce into some delicious dynamic sweeping
 chord changes drop teases you by offering and then withholding a beautiful
 groove that sounds like antonio carlos jobim taking a stab at writing funk and
 then another view point finishes the job tone twilight zone is the equivalent
 of a boards of canada pastoral played live brazil applies singingmacintosh
 software to a gorgeous laidback ode with an oddly countryandwestern chorus
 breakdown and fly is a flatout prog single in the best possible way
 cornelius has done well and hes done it subtly and unassumingly if youve spent
 the last six months feeling inclined to listen solely to altcountry records this
 may be officially not your bag but its a handsome little bag and undoubtedly
 some people will take great great pride in wearing it outthe fine people at ninja tune would like you to believe that up bustle and outs
 master sessions vol 2 is a landmark collaboration ignoring cultural
 boundaries to bring together two divergent musical styles to create something new
 theyd like you to believe it and frankly i wish i could
 heres how clandestine ein and rupert mould aka up bustle and out create
 their music first they sculpt beats and soundscapes out of old vinyl then
 they wrangle up musicians and ask them to play over what theyve created finally
 they paste everything together adding reverb and effects shifting pitches and
 employing other such newfangled nonsense where needed for the twopart master
 sessions series the duo has traveled to cuba in search of sounds and musicians
 theyve even brought portishead bassist jim barr along for the ride though they
 spend most of this album working with master flautist longtime bandleader and
 buena vista social club guy richard eges and his orchestra
 its an interesting idea certainly and the divergent nature of the projects
 participants has resulted in some interesting parallels the results are presented
 not as a collection of up bustle and out songs but instead as a sort of audio
 documentary of the project the disc itself is something of a mixed bag its
 tracks ranging from dub to downtempo triphop to traditional cuban jazz to
 beatdriven hiphop instrumentals taken as a standard album this utter disregard
 for thematic unity can be irritating but taken as a part of a whole package
 it also includes a cdrom full of super 8 films of the sessions and a written
 account of the duos time with our neighbors to the south the disc begins to
 make quite a bit of sense
 the first two tracks are pretty standard ninjatune fare the sort of thing those
 whove only heard up bustle and out on compilations are probably expecting
 coffee contamination is a darkly brooding downtempodub track with soulful
 saxophone a steadytoned cowbell handclaps and heavy echoing standup bass
 all of this builds to an upbeat drummachine loop that breaks away to a sampled
 cuban vocal which carries over into a repetition of the initial theme but if
 this song is the plane ride to cuba the next is the arrival mariel port
 spanish harlem begins as a solid funk original until it reaches its bridge and
 handpercussion and subtleatfirst effects transform it into a dubfried
 blaxploitation theme
 from there master sessions vol 2 takes a different turn descarga
 caramelo is the first of a number of traditional cuban jazz tracks featuring
 eges and his orchestra the transition is somewhat jarring not unlike say the
 culture shock that must come when two americans set foot in cuba
 the cuban jazz in many ways isnt too far removed from its origins a simple
 piano part gets repeated as claves get claved and cowbells get cowbelled a few
 times we hear the words yo quiero caramelo and then come the solos first a
 saxophonist and then eges and his magic flute then hand drums then piano
 next eges trades eighths with the saxophonist a riff stolen from richie
 valens la bamba is the only way to date the piece before we return to the
 candycoveting refrain theres a laidback element to most of these recordings
 as evidenced by the background chatter which seems almost purposely enhanced on
 tracks like the organandflute duet organo de bayamo the music is simple yet
 effective both in form and content a throwback to the past
 this oldfashioned sensibility shows up repeatedly on tracks not unlike this one
 but its most evident on the album closer a collage of dat recordings made by the
 duo entitled made in cuba pt 2 on one we can just barely hear a conversation
 over the roaring of a nearby motor in another we hear a man passionately cry out
 a melody as he keeps a beat with assorted hand percussion in a third a woman
 sings an acoustic guitar is strummed and a crowd mumbles in the distance thats
 it simple as can be
 its all fine music dont get me wrong i think i can honestly say that i enjoy
 every track on master sessions 2 still it leaves a key question unanswered
 what happens when ein and mould collaborate with eges and his orchestra sadly
 we never really find out tracks like jazz sepulchre sees the duo sampling the
 orchestra yes but they never manage to truly capture the flavor of what these
 musicians are doing again the music is still solid but its something of a
 disappointment to see such a crosscultural collaboration hinted at but never
 really achieved
 though at times a bit too disjointed for its own good most notably in the
 differing recording styles the clean up bustle and out tracks often dont
 match with the intentionally unclean sessions master sessions 2 still
 works if not as a document of a unique musical and cultural meeting then at
 least as a solid collection of songs and thats a good thing no matter what
 culture youre a part ofits all been said so many times before i probably dont even need to go beyond
 this half of you know what im going to say i feel trite just thinking about
 it and yet as is always the case necessity squelches the desire for originality
 here goes
 
 this live album while a musthave for diehard fans of the group will disappoint
 those who are looking for an inspiringly different interpretation of the bands
 canon
 
 live albums are tricky business one out of fifty times a live album provides a
 stunning insight into a spontaneous dynamic performance or a collection of
 particularly outstanding performances spanning a given period of time the other
 fortynine times a live recording is little more than a collection of a bands
 songs run through a bulldozer and stripped of a good deal of their ornamentation
 complexity and character and thus the above statement comes into play if you
 love the songs youll love the slightly different versions of the songs if you
 dont give a fuck about the songs youre wasting your time
 
 in the case of erics trip the live treatment does marginally alter the nature of
 the bands music sometimes allowing some extra vibrancy and energy to come through
 but almost always removing a good deal of the charm that makes their albums so
 appealing erics trip slapped together beauty and noise in a fantastically
 haphazard manner jumping with reckless abandon from lazily strummed acoustic
 guitars to hectic screeching feedback on the erics trip show the
 contrast between the various sounds employed by the band is greatly downplayed
 replaced by a steady stream of consistently rocking numbers
 
 which is not to say that there arent some absolutely lovely songs on the erics
 trip show the album opens with stove a classic cut from the bands debut
 love tara featuring julie doirons gorgeous breathy vocals its all well
 and good but it doesnt do much in comparison to the original with its dreamy
 cymbal crashes and intensely intimate recording quality
 
 indeed the loss of intimacy is a big problem with this album as the closeup
 lofi recording that helped make erics trips proper albums so great is no longer
 a factor the band plays their songs through and the songs themselves are pretty
 damned good on tracks like blinded mark chris julie and rick really start
 to rip shit up a needed blast of energy and a nice addition to the erics
 trip show but certainly no replacement for the moments of sheer brilliance
 that can be found in the bands albums
 
 which brings me back to the original point the songs on the erics trip show
 are very good songs id venture to say that some of the more straightup rock
 numbers actually sound better here than they do on studio lps but generally
 speaking this album leaves erics trip without some of their greatest musical
 assets if youre in love with the songs this probably wont matter to you if
 youre not this wont help but you already knew thatbands like this dont come around everyday or rather bands like this usually
 take a while to develop before coming around i imagine a half decade or so of
 learning the ropes releasing things that go nowhere except as oneoff tracks on
 mix tapes for that girl you met at that local band concert last weekend usually
 the bands get some kind of grassroots following starting in their town and they
 luck into getting featured on a cmj sampler and then get namedropped on an
 indie zine yearend poll if only by the guy who likes a bunch of noname hardcore
 bands fairly soon afterwards the band releases an ep on a big independent
 label and are the talk of free publications everywhere though still so far
 underground to the general public as to be relatively nonexistent in the greater
 scheme of things
 
 at some point this band will tour with a slightly bigger unknown band who has
 been receiving props from the same zines for a couple of years now and who is
 at the point where their next record has to be a hit or theyll lose the attention
 of big labels indie or not and big venues and the little band whos still very
 much on the way up who has worked their sound into a precise angry young package
 hardly sees that unless they headline the same tour next year theyre well on
 the way to becoming yesterdays news but theyre probably still a good band
 whose only flaw was taking a little time to develop
 
 but gaji is here and they are fullgrown of course they had their small
 beginnings in tokyo in the early 90s but didnt release anything save some
 singles and seveninches until 1999 when their first record garnered them exactly
 the same kind of underground raves in japan i was talking about they played
 shows with the right people ruins among others got compared to the right
 people meltbanana and zeni geva to name a couple and if they had only been
 distributed outside of their country theyd have doubtlessly made the infamous
 indie splash in all parts
 
 the great thing i hear in this band is that they dont appear to be playing
 towards their peers or press ten to ten past ten their second
 fulllength sounds like a punk band who somehow learned that just playing the
 old sound or even updating the old sound for allimportant cred points
 wasnt really the point gaji a fourpiece led by vocalist yuko hasegawa
 plays music rather distinct and passionate and i hope they have as little
 regard for the formula of making it big as i do this introduction isnt my
 ad for the band but it is something of a thankyou note to people who play
 their stuff without much pretense other than jamming out seriously hard shit
 just like the old bands used to do yet dont sound like anyone one else
 thats gaji as far as i can tell
 
 in japan they get lumped in with meltbanana but theyre hardly that spastic
 instead opting for surprisingly intricate sometimes broaching minimalist guitar
 and basslines albeit very aggressive ones southwest leads off the album with
 hasegawa spitting out lines like string puller beat ruler beat ruler inciter
 protesting who knows what injustice over angular guitar and basslines seemingly
 more suited to old school mathrock bands like slint or don caballero thing is
 this isnt some abstract brainfreeze music but as punk as anything sst put out
 of course they dont really sound like black flag but you probably guessed that
 by now
 
 flower of conspiracy actually starts with little more than a simple soft guitar
 figure accompanied by clicking drumsticks it gives way to a bit of feedback and
 then dives into a very straightforward almost droning piece of music drummer
 chisaki taguchi never plays more than is absolutely necessary to carry the band
 and the bass and guitar worry so little about fleshing out the sound youd think
 it was a demo if not for hasegawas priceless deadpan vocals which are often
 similar to the waitresses patty donahue or even exene cervenka at her most
 passionately desensitized but when hasegawa drops lyrics like spinning spiral
 in a silence and men betray repeatedly lament i dont doubt she has quite a
 bit of emotion invested in this
 
 the best moment of the album for me comes in the transition between mute and
 the title track the former is a lengthy tune with only single word exclamations
 from hasegawa and a rhythm section that sounds like it was recorded in my hallway
 with all the edges smoothed out by natural reverb and repeating guitar figure
 that would make tortoise proud this builds for several minutes and then pop
 nothing the whole thing disappears only to explode into ten to ten past ten
 guitarist yui kimijimi has his robert frippmeetsd boon riffs down pat and then
 some this is their best tune due not least to the extremely compact arrangement
 again no wasted notes amazing riffs or circus freak intensity and an odd
 vocal landing on notes that somehow turn the mood from angry and resistant to
 something like mystical hardcore its a very strange inspiring song check the
 chronic depressed states be over line for further proof
 
 now for the bad news youre probably going to have to work to get this as it
 hasnt been released outside of japan once again the indie cycle of failure
 threatens to strike but if youre willing to look around you can find it gaji
 arent going to change the world with this release but i suppose given the right
 set of circumstances and a willing audience they could get a chapter in the
 arcane annals of punk bands like this fully formed and beyond being ready to
 fight are rare enough that even if they arent getting their due off the island
 theyll probably find a way to make waves elsewherebrady tips his hat to floyd on his way back to the ranch ignoring the heat of the
 late afternoon sun and the sweat pouring from beneath the brim of his freshly
 purchased tengallon hat at the sight of the ranch house he sighs with relief
 and leaves his tired horse at the edge of the porch
 
 his spurs clank with each footfall and he notes the damage done to his fancy new
 boots as he trudges up the stairs at the door he reacquaints himself with his
 reflection in the window and knocks
 
 come on in
 
 he enters and sees his employer gar price fumbling with a small black box
 you seen these asks gar cd player
 
 you wanted to ask me something boss
 
 yeah yeah gar mutters offers a box of cigars smoke
 
 dont mind if i do brady strikes a match against the heel of his boot you
 wanted to see me
 
 well brady i got this new cd for the newfangled phonograph there band called
 little grizzly texas boys ever heard of them
 
 i reckon i havent says brady
 
 its these four renegade cowboys from up round denton leaders george neal and
 hes got some real city slickin ways about him i think thats mighty suspicious
 
 yessir
 
 ill be damned if i know what to make of this music i know youre something of
 an educated man brady and i was wonderin if you could make heads or tails of
 this
 
 gar pushes a button on the black box and the room floods with music
 
 five cigars and six tequizas later after a long period of critical evaluation
 interspersed with gar onesided conversation about upkeep on the ranch
 brady offers i gotta admit i like that george neal fellers vocals he sounds
 like wayne coyne with a western tinge hand over that case yeah this songs
 called today is the day i like that part at the chorus where things start to
 sound a little more like a sloppy flaming lips thats a good thing by the way
 
 and the lyrics aint bad really sorta funny and absurd and poignant at the same
 time like on charlotte which seems to be about a robot though i aint sure
 that song may be more your speed shows more of its countryroots just george
 neal and an acoustic guitar
 
 right pretty says gar
 
 theres a coupla waltzes on this disc replies brady the first i though i knew
 better than that is louder but if you dont mind me sayin the undue twang
 makes it sound like novelty the second mockingbird glasses is a whole other
 story feels antiquated even the lyrics allude to a sort of sepiatoned past of
 mockingbird glasses torn waistcoat and glasses and old movie posters the
 organ work is nice in this song adds character to the song without overwhelming
 the other instruments and i tell you what sir thats becoming a rarity these
 days this george neal is a heckuva multiinstrumentalist
 
 city slicker gar responds whatd i tell you
 
 well boss listen up here in sleep foreign engine its a sad sort of
 antilullaby good song but the real high point comes with the horn section
 about halfway through
 
 son i dont know what in tarnation youre talking about
 
 ill sum up little grizzly writes countryflavored indie pop with more of an
 edge than say jay farrars last album theyre not afraid to turn up the amps
 and rock uncle tupelostyle when the time is right but it seems somehow wrong to
 keep drawing comparisons to altcountry bands with few exceptions charlotte
 mockingbird glasses their best stuff comes when they keep the country to a
 minimum and the worst tracks on the album i knew better than that drum
 major show the downhome flavor getting the better of george neal over the
 top dialect and affectation only go so far consider for example this review
 
 on the whole its a pretty good compact disc they take a fairly basic formula
 youve probly heard before and make it sound reasonably fresh some songs are so
 catchy they feel almost like guilty pleasures i say give it a try or two itll
 probably grow on you
 
 well i thank you brady says gar but i think its about time we wrap
 this up
 
 yes sir i reckon so but how
 
 gars head turns into that of a goats and his hands become like giant katana
 blades bradys boss has revealed his true identity and now he speaks with
 a voice that is as thunder i am the demon lord abadon embrace satan
 quickly he plunges his mighty katanahands into brady who can only utter if
 you dont mind my sayin so i certainly did not see that comin sir whereupon
 abadon feasts upon the lifeless flesh of his employee until he finally bursts into
 several smaller demons and disappears through the wallswhen the chemical brothers are on top of their game its hard for anyone in their
 genre to touch them in those moments their sound threatens to go completely over
 the top the massive beats and electronic squelches ripping through the speakers
 like theyre about to physically jump out into your living room back in 97 i
 would drive around listening to block rockin beats unable to feel like anything
 but a bad motherfucker i might have only been behind the wheel of a jetta but
 thats not the issue
 
 of course a good way to judge a chemical brothers album is via the egoinflation
 factor if youre feeling like al capone with a fat bank roll and a baseball bat
 the brothers are achieving the desired effect if you feel like youre shopping
 for designer footwear things have veered horribly offcourse the fact is the
 chemical brothers greatest strength lies in their ability to lay down irresistibly
 fat basslines and breakbeats that would make bootsy collins fingers bleed a
 good chemical brothers track should bulldoze any form of criticism simply because
 its a strictly visceral experience you press play and send the frontal cortex
 to its room to play with blocks for a while
 
 the big question going into come with us was whether theyd come out kungfu
 fighting or serve up another batch of watereddown techno beats like those dished
 out on their previous album surrender i wanted to see them rely less on
 guest cameos almost invariably a bad sign bernard sumner and hope sandoval
 should stay as far away from the studio as possible preferably with a 300pound
 bouncer with a pit bull screening the door and they generally do sure beth
 orton and richard ashcroft managed to get their fingers in the pie but some of
 these tracks also return to what the chemical brothers do best in the end its
 a mixed bag
come with us flies out of the gates unexpectedly with its first three
 tracks immediately dragging the listener through a relentless torrent of beats
 and sonic energy the title track with its agitated looped strings undulating
 waves of syrupy keyboards shouts and strong backbeat is reminiscent of the
 beastie boys at their most raucous it began in afrika is a rapid heartpounding
 conga workout that distills the quick reflexes and primal urges of a cheetah hunt
 under a deadpan voice repeating it began in afrikakaka and galazy bounce
 features a repeated callandresponse sample over tight driving slapbass funk
 none of this is a thoughtprovoking music in the slightest and i wouldnt want
 it any other way these tracks are purely functional all speed sweat and
 clenched muscle and as convenient packets of immediate party energy they
 succeed admirably well
 
 of course its when the chemical brothers deviate from their role as big beat
 deities that problems arise star guitar apparently substitutes for the missing
 sumner track its slight but not nearly as vapid as hoops the song that
 follows it honestly none of the remaining material returns to the quality of
 the first three cuts though my elastic eye and denmark do manage to turn up
 the heat a bit but theres not much to be said about the orton the state
 were in and ashcroft the test numbers other than that theyre both about
 as middleoftheroad as you might expect theyd be the test for example
 sounds like a weak companion piece to the simple minds dont you forget about
 me and ortons admittedly seductive vocals arent nearly enough to rescue an
 inherently bad song
 
 yep come with us is another let down no two ways about it and all
 because tom rowlands and ed simons seem confused about where theyd like to go
 there are certain things they do very well yet they dont seem to be content
 with being pigeonholed as onedimensional unfortunately onedimensional is
 about the only thing they can pull off convincinglyi love rushmore you love rushmore too admit it id wager my lunch money that 98 of regular pitchfork readers see at least a little bit of themselves in the blue blazer and thick glasses of max fisher weve all had hopeless crushes on teachers been thrown out of prep schools and written stage adaptations of apocalypse now you know figuratively likerushmore also appealed to me and to you as a rare example of the effective musical movie where the songs and score perfectly complemented the action on screen its no small wonder then that the accompanying soundtrack was one of the best in recent memory playing like a mixtape with selections hand picked by fisher himself british invasion chestnuts from creation and the kinks reflected the angst and paranoia of the films teenage protagonist while devo founder mark mothersbaughs quirky score spoke for the slightly offkilter charm of the film unlike the thinly veiled label showcases masquerading as inspired by soundtracks for most of todays movies the rushmore soundtrack worked as both souvenir and autonomous albumwhich brings us to the royal tenenbaums the new flick from the team that brought you rushmore and its companion album again you get a healthy helping of mothersbaugh score which largely finds him exploring much of the same territory of rushmore ie the limitless potential of a jazz quartet consisting of acoustic guitar vibraphone harpsichord and drums and again the score weaves in and out between a choice sampling of 60s and 70s rock albeit this time from slightly bigger names dylan velvets ramones etcbut like the disillusioned characters of its cinematic parent tenenbaums songs deal with the more adult issues of loneliness and dissatisfaction rather than the sexual frustration swagger of garage rock the films bittersweet melancholy is represented by the plaintive acoustic singersongwriter and the lush orchestrated chamber pop set piecethese two threads are combined in the bookend tracks by dictionarydefinition chanteuse nico ill admit to never really appreciating her contributions on the first velvet underground album her female bela lugosi vocalizing always seemed like a particularly unfunny andy warhol joke but these days and the fairest of the seasons with their delicate fingerpicking and tasteful strings somehow fit her valiant struggles with the english language in a more earpleasing mannerthe threads of nicos ruminations on loneliness what didnt she bang jim morrison are picked up by the folky stylings of someone named emitt rhodes and everyones favorite mope elliott smith furthering the widely held theory that first names ending in tt lead to chronic depression both are excellent examples of a genre i call showerrod swinging music or just kozelekmer for short smiths needle in the hay especially lives up to the term given the scene from the film in which it playsbut nothing says desolation like stringed instruments playing in a minor key and both nick drake and the yseye quartet are happy to provide the latters performance of ravels string quartet in f major a composition im sure we all know and appreciate cough cough blends particularly well with the more expansive mothersbaugh score contributions with its playful pizzicato and frenetic string basssurprisingly its the mothersbaugh score that steals the spotlight on the entire album providing a kind of modern classical music that walks the thin line between complete avantgarde unlistenability and yanniism the many unexpected twists and turns of the epic 718 lindbergh palace hotel suite a sudden drop into reggae an extended drum solo make more sense in the film but on disc serve as brilliantly absurd flourishes in the midst of a twinkling orchestral piece mothersbaughs canon and sparkplug minuet similarly showcase his growth as a film composer by incorporating a childrens choir and flutesnot all the song selection fits and abets the mood however the clashs police and thieves and the ramones judy is a punk are both great songs undoubtedly but stick out with their increased volume and attitude bob dylans wigwam is from the heretofore unknown moaning along with a brass section phase of his career 1970 to be exact and is rather unpleasant their inclusion is befuddling considering the more thematically appropriate songs from the movie left off the soundtrack van morrisons harpsichorddriven everyone or mothersbaughs merrygoround organ version of hey judewhile rushmore captured the turmoil of youth the royal tenenbaums soundtrack aims to portray more mature emotions than those of a hormonecrazed fifteenyearold boy and mostly succeeds but then again youre over that crush on miss cross tooheres a little known fact rock critics like physicists biologists and food
 scientists are perennially seeking theories to institute order upon the chaotic
 world around them every musical scribe aspires to create something as elegant
 as scott copperwoods historic the inevitability of the concept album or
 patrick reillys famous cleavage low neckline huge country music sales
 study today as a pitchfork exclusive im going to let you in on my
 mostvalued personal theoretical creation the bandsinlove axiom
 
 the bandsinlove axiom is a concept more effectively shown than described the
 first couple of indie rock kim gordon and thurston moore flaunted it with the
 heavenly harmonies of cotton crown though it rarely applied after that lows
 alan sparhawk and mimi parker show that mormons can do it too but often keep it
 restrained under their slowcore blanket caithlin de marrais and kyle fischer of
 rainer maria tapped into it occasionally on their first two albums but gave it
 up to try to be a lowrent my bloody valentine on a better version of me
 still for a long time tinfoil off of rainers first album served as the
 linchpin of my theory the opening goddammit the vocal harmony equivalent
 of loves beautiful train wreck
 
 but then last spring i stumbled upon a tiny little band named the mates of state
 in san francisco and lo my theory was made flesh the mates stripped away all
 those superfluous band members not involved in the central relationship leaving
 just two people thoroughly infatuated with each other kori gardner played her
 vintage yamaha organ jason hammel banged his drums and both sang not just
 together but to each other their eyes locked onstage in what my friend described
 best as the love gaze their debut album my solo project captured this
 vibe surprisingly well with lines like i color the sky with you i let you
 choose the blue warming the cockles of even the most steelyhearted listener
our constant concern the bands first album for polyvinyl records
 promised that the duo was sticking to the same tight formula causing me to rub
 my hands in mad scientistlike anticipation of more support for my theory but
 alas it was not to be the musical spark is gone and furthermore things are
 apparently still all holding hands and eskimo kisses for kori and jason
 considering the occurrence of their marriage between albums my theory whats
 happened to my beautiful theory
 
 its actually really hard to put a finger on what isnt clicking this time out
 for the mates as one would think a twoperson band couldnt adjust their sound
 too dramatically one possible culprit is the general slowing of the material
 by my count a good six of ten tracks stroll along at a tempo best described as
 mid easing off the gas pedal isnt always a bad thing but here it seems to
 drain a good portion of the energy the band showed previously
 
 furthermore this time around gardner seems to be using a greater variety of the
 organs effects rather than focusing upon the guitarish sound of my
 solo project i want so badly not to mention quasi but think quasi
 the strategic change allows us to sample the keyboards seemingly endless
 repertoire such as the xylophonesteel drum sound and a brilliantly fakesounding
 brass synthesizer but without the fuzzy crunch and hammondesque bass of the
 distorted setting the new songs sound well a lot like its only two people
 playing
 
 most traumatic of all however is the mates movement away from the fantastic
 pseudoharmonies of earlier work on songs like lahov and throw down from
 the first album gardner and hammel each belted out vocal parts that wrapped
 around each other in a way far from technically perfect and thrillingly so
 the harmonies on our constant concern tracks like 10 years later and
 girls singing are far less eccentric and less vibrant sometimes resorting
 to mere unison singing
 
 the old magic pops up here and there as in the enjoyably ridiculous gracelandlike
 vocal intro to quit doin it and the sugarhigh two minutes of halves and
 havenots but these brief flashes even on a thirtyminute album do little to
 keep the dreaded sophomore slump virus from hitting our constant concern
 perhaps sadly the bandinlove axiom is only good for one great album per act
 until next time though the romanticist in me will hope otherwise cmon guys
 do it for my theorybecause i cant really talk about new wet kojak without referencing girls against
 boys and because it seems like nobody can talk about girls against boys without
 referencing sex were gonna talk about sex appeal and how it is that scott
 mccloud and johnny temple in both their flagship band and their side project
 came to sound like henry millers edits when discussing their music man do you
 hear that libidinous croon dont you dig that sexy swaggering comehitherandfuckme
 bassline
 
 im not entirely comfortable with talking about libidinous crooning if only
 because ive always associated it with permed hairychested geezers and some
 combination of pity and repulsion which could mean that new wet kojak vocalist
 scott mccloud is a shoein for ladies nite at the starlite lounge in twenty years
 or so that aside though mcclouds vocal stylings work well perhaps even
 better than in the gvsb setting with the jazzy ambient coolerthanthou
 character of new wet kojak in fact when he talks about rock stars big tippers
 sophia loren and living the low life on no 4 it makes it easier for the
 listener to believe he knows whereof he speaks
 
 of course this is all tongueincheek mostly the opening track livin 2 low
 opens with a spacy ambient loop and a smooth rhythm section somewhat reminiscent
 of latter day u2 and right when youre about to start slithering about the dance
 floor mccloud imparts these sexy thoughts the world thirsts for a car deodorant
 the life as advertised ive long believed girls against boys smirked at press
 that perceived their sexywithanedge shtick as anything more than an affectation
 likewise new wet kojak takes the affectation so far overboard that its hard not
 to believe mccloud and temple arent satirizing themselves livin 2 low with
 its princestyle syntax title seems paean to the steamy saturdaynightout and
 winks at the audience and to clarify its not a hey baby sort of wink
 
 do the math is an infectious new wavedisco hybrid romp that as a standalone
 track nearly justifies the release of the entire single its fairly simple
 forgoing the ambient gloss of the other tracks for playful bass charles benningtons
 terrific saxophones which make a serious case for the widespread reintegration of
 the sax into the indie dancepop idiom and sly lyrics like real chicks prefer
 rock stars do the math sophia loren meanwhile opens with the sound of horns
 and delicate guitar work building into a crashing sneering ruckus unsurprisingly
 evocative of prefreakonica girls against boys featuring a strangely
 metalguitar flavored sax solo
 
 unfortunately the energy of the first three tracks falls away on year of the
 sheep an unnecessarily dirgelike beatpoetryjam rides over one of the most
 repetitive piano lines ive ever heard making this a clear candidate for some
 throwaway compilation contribution or if nothing else the garbage can ditto
 the remix of love career the original version one of the high points on do
 things was hardly begging for a remix as it was and the no 4 version
 integrating naptime strings samples and uninspired drum loops is simply boring
 
 so this is a tough call ratingwise sixty percent of this cd is dead on a solid
 follow up to 2000s do things and indicator of good things to come but
 the last two tracks sully the picture a bit ill grant that everyone even
 libidinous crooners have bad days and some of those bad days are sort of
 interesting the second half of this ep however is boring and theres nothing
 less sexy than thatcontrary to popular belief the scariest part of any horror movie is not the
 moment when the psychotic killer springs out from behind some inconspicuous chunk
 of scenery and plunges his machete into the heart of his poor unsuspecting victim
 the truly frightening part of any scary film lies in those painstakingly drawnout
 moments before the bloody death when the soontobe victim is creeping through
 some deserted mansionwharfwarehouse as a string section pulsates toward some
 crescendo that always lingers just vaguely out of reach this is the unsettling
 part not because of anything thats happening onscreen but because of what the
 audience knows must be coming the question is never what will happen but when
 and the best horror films are those that toy with the audience always keeping
 the answer to that ubiquitous question a surprise
 the same principals in many ways hold true to jazz as magnificent as a spirited
 freeimprovised burst of ballsout drumthumping vicious bassplunking bloodrushing
 hornskronking and furious pianothumping may be the true measure of a band is
 how they find their way in and out of such moments how they build foreshadow
 and sneak quietly away after the deed is done
 the goodheart allen powell trio knows enough to linger on the quiet moments the
 first four minutes of the trios debut recording i can climb a tree i can tie
 a knot i can have a conversation bears resemblance to john cages early
 chance orchestrations or the art ensemble of chicago in their most abstract form
 silences abound sounds come in spurts and often step on each others toes while
 theres an innate feeling that the musicians are responding to each other at
 times it seems theyre playing by a logic only they can understand
 by the time
 saxophonist josh allen pipes in with our first hints of structure riffing on the
 first few notes of amazing grace no less weve already grown comfortable with
 the idea of this loosefitting avantjazz trio but when matthew goodheart and
 garth powell jump on this bandwagon playing piano and percussion respectively
 sending the jam flying out of orbit and into the aforementioned wildandcrazy
 avantfreakout stuff all notions of comfort are thrown out the window this is
 when with one welltimed cymbalcrash the whole thing comes to a dead halt
 then against a backdrop of silence as if to comfort the unnerved listener
 goodheart plunks out a soothing lullaby before the song entitled waiting for
 our careers to take off is over this too will have mutated into another one
 of these freakouts
 still the noisy moments are atypical most of i can climb a tree is quiet
 subtle indeed these occasional spurts of madness seem present mostly for contrasts
 sake to grab you by the shirtsleeve before shifting back to quiet exploration
 any good horror film will have its fair share of suspenseful moments that build
 to a letdown you know those scenes where a character creeps down a dark hallway
 his fear heightened by clichd music opens the door and the audience subconsciously
 braces themselves only to find the characters friend standing on the other side
 of the door these scenes serve to build suspense similarly songs like the
 water is wet which register as little more than dynamic ripples after the
 drastic shifts of the two opening tracks serve to string listeners along which
 makes those songs which do crescendo like the comparatively straightforward
 accumulation 1 that much more effective
 all this comes as a pleasant surprise to the music critic who seeing three names
 he didnt recognize on the cover of a jazz album immediately became skeptical
 but not only are goodheart allen and powell all solid musicians in their own
 right they also work together in such a way that makes it difficult to believe
 this is only their first recording together granted a look at their lineage
 explains a lot these are musicians whove worked with the likes of eugene
 chadbourne cecil taylor and mats gustafsson its no wonder their music is so
 damned seamless tight enough that they must be scripted yet too natural and too
 bizarre to be anything but improvised this is a group that frolics at first loose
 notes falling where they may only to snap to attention like a terrified private at
 the first sound of his commanders gruff voice at times the goodheart allen powell
 trio may seem random but theyre anything but imprecise continually surprising
 yes but not scary in the leastwhen i hear the name steve albini i tend to think of a certain sound namely
 raw primal rock rapeman big black shellac nirvanas in utero the
 pixies the mans name is practically synonymous with music that takes no
 prisoners his dry trebleheavy sound has graced literally hundreds of albums
 over the past decadeandahalf and his style has become so developed that a lot
 of people can listen to an album and tell that he recorded it
 
 considering all this you can imagine how shocked i was to open the liner notes
 of the frames fourth album and see his name in there for the most part for
 the birds is just about the antithesis of what weve come to expect from
 albini gentle hushed folkinspired rock that only occasionally rises to a shout
 as it turns out albini only helped record a few songs for the irish quintet and
 though its never specified which ones its easy to guess the rest of the album
 was produced by the band with the guiding hand of deuss craig ward who seems
 nearly as unlikely a candidate
for the birds opens with a plaintive soothing instrumental aptly titled
 in the deep shade guitar harmonics brushed drums violin and a smattering of
 piano eddy about calmly sometimes moving forward rhythmically for a bar or two
 but never truly settling into a prolonged groove of any kind its little short
 of the perfect setup for an album that abounds in pleasantly atmospheric but
 rarely uninteresting music broken by the occasional foray into noisedrenched
 slow rock
 
 lay me down follows riding a constant choppy beat and lightly picked acoustic
 guitars glen hansards vocal melody is syncopated in such a way that it sounds
 at first like hes singing out of time once you get used to his phrasing though
 the melody takes hold easily contrasted by slow droning violin interjections
 between verses hansards understated delivery also works nicely for what
 happens when the heart just stops the quiet ballad that follows subtle
 electronics weave their way through the mix gradually becoming denser as the
 song swells to its dramatic climax complete with a fine left bankeish horn
 section
 
 though most of the album keeps the tempo held way back a few songs manage to
 inject a faster beat and nearly always to positive effect most notable is
 fighting on the stairs which is the most obvious candidate for a single
 programmed drums lay down an almost danceable groove for an otherwise mostly
 acoustic song making for a nice blend of textures banjo and vibes fill in
 the corners of the song leaving room for some sort of oscillating synthesizer
 and closely harmonized vocals
 
 three of these songs bear the obvious mark of albini each in the form of harshly
 noisy guitar passages the band handles noise best on headlong by balancing it
 with resolutely melodic violin and lead guitar parts which isnt to speak of the
 way they easily morph the gentle chorus refrain into an aching plea for help in
 the raging bridge the noisy passage that closes santa maria however is
 fairly shapeless and actually detracts from an otherwise passable song
 
 the guitars are similarly molten on early bird though the vocal melody greatly
 overpowers them in the mix the song quiets in the middle to allow the sinewy
 violin line to come to the fore but is quickly swallowed again by restrained
 feedback and gritty guitar work its duration is cut short by an uncharacteristic
 moment of tape manipulation which segues surprisingly well into friends and foe
 which is perhaps the most subdued song here subtle tremolo picking in the
 background understated splashes from a keyboard and soft strumming are all
 hansard has for accompaniment during the ultraquiet verses a surprisingly dirty
 threelike violin and guitar section actually brightens the song considerably in
 the middle
 
 disappointed takes the title of most lofi song on the album as hansard sounds
 like hes phoning in his performance from another town thats not to say his
 delivery isnt as passionate as usual though and his lyrics seem to sum up the
 general feel of the whole album with their refrain of im not mad im just
 disappointed comparatively closer mighty sword is upbeat at its tempo of
 roughly 60 beats per minute the song picks up for its coda breaking into a
 steady waltz beneath cleanly strummed guitars and theremin
 
 the frames have created a unique and enjoyable album with for the birds
 one that leans decidedly away from the pop spectrum but never sacrifices
 accessibility perhaps the albums single greatest flaw is that the band have
 chosen to concentrate almost too much on the slow and sparse but they do it well
 enough that its hard to complain too much when alls said and done for the
 birds is really for just about anyonecause youre so hollywood
 youre so hollywoooowood
 i got to get out of this town
 
 youre so hollywood or talkin ed mcmahon powerball schizoid blues
 
 only a year ago flickerstick was an obscure band floating around texas building
 a small following peddling their first album from the trunk of their car and
 looking for a break perseverance and hope are defining american traits though
 and the same urge that drives us to play the same powerball number week after
 week or the reflex that forces me to renew my good housekeeping
 subscription another year just to give myself a better shot at that publishers
 clearing house jackpot is the same urge that drives your typical upandcoming
 allamerican band the same vw van the same stages the same shitty equipment
 and twice married groupies but someday somewhere the right person will hear
 the right demo and everything will change darva conger fantasies do come true
 swallow your pride for a second and you can buy your memories for the rest of
 your life
dont sell out dont sell out dont sell out
 you compromise every word you say
 
 got a feeling or babe you done got yourself a cadillac now
 
 as it turns out flickerstick contributed a song to a compilation of music by
 itinerant bands which the right person did hear the band was subsequently
 chosen by vh1 to appear on their new reality program bands on the run a
 film crew was assigned to follow the group on tour and the public was treated
 to a firsthand glimpse of everyday life on the road the parties the women
 the whispered exploits previously witnessed solely by roadies and those lucky
 enough to be with the band were on display to shock amaze and entertain
 primetime american families across the nation another set of boozing rocking
 hotel trashing working class heroes was born
 
 week after week viewers tuned in to halfpay attention to flickersticks ability
 to shake off the previous nights binge and take the stage like they were trying
 too hard to be the best band in the world the vh1 executives were especially
 pleased with the north texas lads after enduring two failed marriages death
 threats and a total loss of privacy flickerstick was rewarded for their troubles
 with 50000 cash 100000 in new equipment a nationwide audience and a record
 deal with epic flickerstick had arrived apparently considering the bands
 recent history coming off of prime time laurelcrowned highly visible to epic
 higherups whoever was in charge of promoting the band decided theyd better
 take all the necessary precautions to get the new signees off on the right foot
 and not fuck things up the cantmiss single beautiful was released for heavy
 circulation on radio and tv and tom lord alge who has worked with blink182
 live and weezer was assigned to remix welcoming home the astronauts for
 rerelease alges thumb in the pie is immediately evident and just as with the
 last weezer album you wish it wasnt there
come on id like to buy the world a coke
 
 coke or and now a word from our sponsors
 
 the heavyhandedness is evident from the start of the albums first track lift
 in whats meant to kick off the album with a sonic liftoff which i assume
 conceptually ties in with the astronaut theme of the albums title brandin leas
 voice rises awkwardly through low electronic drones and soothing feedback in what
 turns out to be the countdown to 40 kilotons of arenarock power chords its
 clear from this moment that alges tweaking in the studio has little to do with
 adding anything conceptually to the album and conceptually it comes off as
 little more than rehashed boston and cover art that has as much to do with the
 contents of the album as bostons ufos have to do with more than a
 feeling i think we can sum it up by saying the remixing simply adds enough
 conventional gloss for fm rock to swallow it
 
 and while the studio work is unquestionably lackluster its not as if flickerstick
 themselves really provide much of a hook for the engineers to hang their coats on
 anyway the subsequent cycle of songs ranges all over the map mixing and matching
 strains of 70s hard rock 80s hair bands and 90s postpunk its apparent this is
 a band that was caught looking for an audience
shes only 18 but such a beautiful dream
 all she needs is some chloroform and shell be mine
 
 chloroform the one you love or love in north texas
 
 the lyrics throughout welcoming home the astronauts span a similar gamut
 of styles they move from senseless tiny records spin holding in the air that
 you breathe tearing right through the seams you sew its getting right back to
 you to a poetic sentimentality that only manages to come across as insipid i
 got more than a feeling its a feeling that youll never understand its like
 a rush to my heart that i hope never ends but it all depends on certain
 occasions the guys try to rise to anthemic heights like on the offspring riot
 calls of hey or when the drugs wear off or with the gogosstyle rave up
 youre so hollywood replete with our lips are sealed hand claps or the
 just plain ridiculous chloroform the one you love
 
 its all pretty silly stuff but if nothing else it manages to establish
 flickerstick as a frontrunner for the varsity blues ii soundtrack
 welcome home the astronauts really only works in two instances on the
 single beautiful and the expansive direct line to the telepathic the
 latter gives the only indication of what flickerstick could be capable of if
 only they werent so obsessed with pandering to massive popularity since this
 seems to be their immediate goal however and they do a good job of sticking
 to the welltrodden paths to mainstream success i see no reason for them to
 fail however commonplace the results of course they may selfdestruct in the
 process in which case we can look forward to seeing them in their next vh1
 special behind the music the flickerstick storyalthough his hardcore compton posturing may have led you to believe otherwise
 tracy morrow aka ice t was not raised in a los angeles ghetto the original
 gangsta was actually born in another og the original garden state new jersey
 but no matter his roots t had gangsta in his goddamn blood after his parents
 died t realized his icecold destiny determined to move to south central and
 adopt the gangsta lifestyle and adopt it he did rising above his critics to rap
 convincingly about killing people selling addictive drugs and enjoying the
 copious bounty of many large black asses
 
 luckily for gillian welch the path to acclaim in the folkcountry genre doesnt
 require moving to oklahoma appalachia or a mississippi riverbank nor does it
 call for songs about killing people peddling crack or mining for black assgold
 in fact the latter is probably anathema to the cause rather its just fine if
 you sound like you know what youre doing and appreciate tradition and welch
 achieves that with ease
 
 gillian welchs third lp time the revelator is ample proof despite being
 born and raised in los angeles the child of a husband and wife songwriting duo
 who scored the theme to the carol burnett show welch has managed to create some
 refreshingly charming rustic folkcountry music that bears the mark of a culture
 buried in the blue ridge 3000 miles removed from her home that shes only 33
 makes her feat of authenticity even more remarkable
 
 welchs sellingpoint are her plaintive vocals as tender as they are weathered
 her voice is in and of itself a stereotype of the south genteel soulful and
 honest even with seemingly frivolous lyrics like on elvis presley blues
 welchs voice expresses depth coloring the song with experienced timewarped
 romanticism
 
 accompanying welch on vocals is a soft palette of acoustic instrumentation
 although the songs carry a greater pop influence than her prior releases the
 sound is still unmistakably country strummed or fingerpicked acoustic guitar
 occupies the foreground on most tracks with the occasional twang of a banjo as
 on the bluesy my first lover adding to the spacious character of the
 orchestration is the albums absence of percussion the result is plenty of room
 for melodies with the focus squarely on welchs voice
time the revelator wavers from heartbroken lament revelator
 everything is free to southern nostalgia i want to sing that rock n roll
 red clay halo but not once does it stray from welchs reflective reserved
 storytellers demeanor the vocals and lyrics alike are open and vulnerable more
 than simply an expression of her music time the revelator is a glimpse
 into the artists personality
 
 those without the heritage need to work to attain their destiny for icet it
 meant moving to compton living the life of a hustler and filming cinematic
 masterpieces like breakin 2 electric boogaloo and frankenpenis
 for gillian welch it meant studying at berklee school of music and listening to
 old delmore brothers and carter family recordings whatever her path though her
 results are as good as the originalklezmer jazz in theory a very cool idea especially because i can always do
 with a little more chaotic joy in my life it seems that of all the things to
 come out of the new york city underground in the 90s this music has been the
 most massively appealing some of the citys biggest names have this trend to
 thank for their prosperity dave douglas with john zorns masada and his own
 tiny bell trio chris speed pachora erik friedlander and jim black pachora
 tiny bell trio all made major statements playing this music bands like pachora
 masada and hasidic new wave take the traditional harmony and melody of klezmer and
 other eastern european music and fuse it with contemporary rhythms and
 improvisation concepts quite often coming up with entirely fresh sounds the
 only problem is that the concept behind the music can never really make the music
 itself inherently fun to listen to
 
 i will say that from the belly of abraham isnt exciting for me not because
 of its nowfamiliar fusion of klezmer and jazz but because of its relentlessly
 lite a feat considering that the playing is theoretically closer to john zorn
 than david sanborn andor smooth atmosphere where i want a hard beat or
 recklessly inspired head i get ultraclean production and tasty in the pocket
 and tight grooves where i beg for something interesting or just something to
 get me on my feet i get something close to the saturday night live band playing
 masada tunes
 
 more amazing is that hasidic new wave is made of guys i love frank london is an
 excellent trumpet player who i first heard on zorns classical work kristallnacht
 but is equally adept at straightahead jazz greg wall is a similarly excellent
 tenor sax player who has the chops and voice to make music ten times more
 distinct than this david fuiczynski is an incredible guitarist and ive never
 heard him so laid back read muffled as on this release drummer aaron alexander
 has worked with folks like satoko fujii and tim berne it just doesnt stand to
 reason that they would form a band that plays relatively smooth jazz
 
 to top it off they brought in a senegalese drum ensemble called yakar rhythms
 a trio of percussionists playing some very complex kinetic patters under all of
 the tunes on this album this really is neat stuff and i wouldnt mind if
 someone removed all of the band tracks and just let me listen to yakar rhythms
 play but that isnt an option in any case they do lend an air of eccentricity
 and genuine excitement to the mix
 
 the first song is waawwaaw written by bassist fima ephon and its clear from
 the start that hasidic new wave will take the beaten path londons expert muted
 trumpet lead is doubled by tenor over a slow jam beat and repetitive bassline as
 yakar rhythms reel off polyrhythms in the background yes the production
 unfortunately views this trio as a background element rather than letting their
 infectious energy take the lead the sheer precision and efficiency of the bands
 playing starts to get me down theres an interesting invocation from one of the
 yakar presumably in senegalese that threatens to bring the tune out of its
 studiopro rut but ultimately to no avail
 
 yemin hashem is a new arrangement of a 19th century jewish hymn and begins
 promisingly with a mournful exposition that quickly leads to a fantastic
 percussion solo but just as the energy gets good and the whole thing seems on
 the verge of explosion they commence a fairly standard james brown think cold
 sweat but accompanied by senegalese drummers of course groove why they
 play the tune proper over this groove even going so far as to add the redoubtable
 jamie saft on funky organ and i wonder how the saturday night live band would
 sound playing this probably about the same even down to the typically expert
 tenor solo
 
 it isnt all a downer fiuczynskis frydginator takes the exotic beats and comes
 with a manic head to match the intensity yes it sounds more than a little like
 masada but then its basically straight klezmer with a jazz bent so thats
 understandable also the solos are very nice with wall and london trading
 fours with real energy and very important seemingly little concern for hitting
 a wrong note playing out of tune or sounding tight i hear some people
 actually go for this type of thing rather than my preferred noise music read
 music youre not likely to play at a dinner party andor hear on npr but i just
 have a hard time getting past the perfectly fineness of itif my band was mentioned in jane magazines cute band alert id be
 worried about looking like some soulless corporaterock posterboy thankfully
 macha put musicianship first after a trip to indonesia the fourpiece fused
 indie rock with eastern instrumentation resulting in polyrhythmic songs full of
 plucked zithers hammered dulcimers and ringing metallophones some said that
 atlantas machamen by using conventional lyrics and choruses had missed the
 point reaching a state of trance but fusion was the point and during their
 live shows with bedhead as macha constantly switched between instruments and
 launched into intense jams you could hear an enlightening vibe far more exciting
 than any jah wobble worldbeat kitsch
 
 seaworthy is the solo project of macha frontman josh mckay hes caught between
 his past and future on the ride which ditches eastern instruments for the
 most part but still focuses on layered waves of sound though in an altogether
 more smooth and subtle approach the ambiance on this lp carries hints of mckays
 premacha days in emperor moth a brooding rock trio from gainesville florida
 all three of mckays projects reveal his draw towards the tension created by the
 drone and the moody keyboards and deep basslines here were captured perfectly in
 the mix done at andy lemasters chase park transduction studio in athens mckays
 balance between abstraction and conventional songwriting has yielded another
 great album
the ride begins with open the gates as a lumbering dreadnought of a
 guitar riff plows through staccato percussion and harpsichordlike ornamentation
 the sinewy lines segue directly into i met her in the candy store the guitars
 become muted and the sinister feeling fades replaced by creaking scrapes of
 feedback crenellated along the main bass groove mckays breathy vocals barely
 raise above a whisper but they manage to make the otherwiseedgy music strangely
 inviting his hushed phrasings are difficult to decipher but you can make out
 your voice invites everyone into contact with your thoughts this piece glides
 into sea manta a wavering aquatic instrumental similar to tortoises dear
 grandma and grandpa
 
 lone star samba is more easily accessible a hihat ticks incessantly amongst
 other soft percussive rumblings as mckay warmly sings talk to me through the
 bedroom wall does your guard come down when im not around the second verse
 begins with vibraphone rolls eddying upward snippets of sampled conversation
 begin to appear in the song little giggles and laughs punctuating the mix with a
 sense of intimacy you and me just one more hour a statement or a plea
 
 instead of revelation a pulsing drone washes into a canyon of reverb on in
 anticipation of a short prelude to the day one of two surprisingly great pop
 tracks that appear in the middle of the album prolific japanese musician haco
 glows here her voice patiently pausing and then echoing dramatically over plodding
 drums and the accompaniment of ringing bell sounds identifying the body features
 vocals from azure ray seraph orenda fink triphop beats shuffle while finks
 electronically filtered voice reaches an otherworldly androgyny even if the hook
 sounds like bono on the fly this song just soars all the more surprising that
 it leads into a disappointing closer the twopart title track the ride aims
 for the blissedout distortion of rems let me in but the avantgarde vocal
 harmony sounds as annoying as the choral theatrics cerberus shoal has been into
 lately the dense wheezing soundbursts arent awful but after so many successful
 tracks this murky sequence is a letdown
 
 the photos on the sleeve cover of the ride are all of bodies a woman
 wrapped in a towel only visible by the light from a window a color shot of
 someones back shadowlit and androgynous a closeup of someones long curly
 hair i wonder whether the concept signifiers the sampled conversation the
 song titles the printed lyrics for the title track is just about a relationship
 or maybe also its collapse the narrative flow is enthralling and might be a
 good opiate during those times its the first good 2002 album ive heard and i
 didnt even get annoyed at the nautical themek is the solo project of ida bassist karla schickele and what a surprise
 her debut fulllength breaks new ground for mediocrity in fact its hard to
 imagine a more nonoffensive collection of songs that take you neither one way
 nor the other new problems is not bad enough to warrant serious disdain
 but neither is it exciting original insightful inspiring cathartic or any of
 the other things i look for in a listening experience if i could id give this
 album a rating of 500000 to emphasize just how middling it is even a bunch of
 guest musicians tara jane oneil schickeles former beekeeper bandmate jan kotik
 and most of the rest of ida couldnt add anything redeeming
 
 things look bleak from the outset first theres the whole idalisa loeb
 connection need i explain and secondly the song telegram is a silvia
 plath poem is set to music i dont know about you but i cant stand silvia
 plath not only does she represent the height of poetic pretension to me but
 the people who are into her writings are arguably more intolerable than her
 poetry
 
 strangely enough telegram was the song i enjoyed the most on the album if you
 want to call it enjoying lets say that after hearing it i shrugged and said
 eh to myself with slightly less vigor than with the other songs but like the
 rest of the album it sat firmly at the tolerable level its a slightly bluesy
 barebones type of song just acoustic guitar and voice and at least for this
 one track schickele doesnt try too hard to be cute or emotive
 
 reminder serves as the emotional highpoint of the album a cautionary tale about
 getting involved with the wrong guy it contains some pretty cheesy lines like
 i dont know your score but i know youre a player i know youre gonna break my
 heart sooner or later if nothing else the song is performed with a little
 conviction though with no better way to express it than a little noisy bit at
 songs end the rest of the album just sort of sits there staring at you neither
 forcing you to get up and turn it off nor leaving you with the desire to hear it
 again
 
 interestingly enough in the brief always so good schickele provides the final
 word on new problems riding a simplified nick drakelike guitar figure
 schickele repeats its always so good but its never the same i cant help
 but think the opposite about this album always the same and never so goodand so another martin luther king day has come and gone and with hardly more than
 a passing notice banks and schools close and theres a brief blurb on the news
 but otherwise little notice is paid maybe human relations have come so far since
 kings day that weve forgotten it was no more than four decades ago when things
 were far different maybe yet for all the advances our society has made in
 civility over the last 40 years weve still got a long way to go racism still
 exists albeit more subtly than before far less subtle in todays society is
 hatred aimed toward homosexuals immigrants and robots yes i said robots
 
 for years robots have been denied the rights you and enjoy each and every day
 theyre thought of as mere machines no one ever taking into account that they
 might just be programmed to feel the pain inflicted by such callous ignorance
 and the media is no better for decades now tv and movies portrayed robots as
 killers servants singleminded ignoramuses incapable of love art or beauty
 but this is a cultural stereotype as inaccurate as any other what about the
 good robots out there the relentless workers the visionaries the musicians
 
 thats right robots can make music too and im not talking about the current
 legions of powerbooktoting humans im talking about real robots like the ones
 pierre bastien employs on his new release mecanoid theyre small simple
 machines built by the artist out of maccano parts and small electric motors
 singlemindedly devoted to making music according to the liner notes these
 robots play everything from castanets and marimbas to thumb pianos and seveninch
 records to steeldrum and an assortment of ancient instruments from around the
 world
 
 its a fair bet that any album that employs such a wide variety of instruments
 will have a pretty unique fairly interesting sound and that mecanoid does
 but this doesnt even take into account the instruments bastien plays standup
 bass electric piano organ horns both prepared and traditional and some more
 obscure instruments that i cant even picture indeed this is a disc filled from
 start to finish with a massive range of sounds but what about the music
 
 the robots musical abilities are limited by their simplicity they play their
 instrument with no divergence from a predetermined pattern essentially creating
 loops as such theres an air of monotony to some of this music a clunking
 mechanical feel but when a number of these robots are employed at once their
 individual patterns inevitably converge in an infinite number of ways bastien
 makes use of this tendency setting any number of robots into action allowing
 their music to fall into a groove and then adding flourishes himself where
 necessary most songs start slow and then creep along with an inhuman determination
 until they reach their conclusion its actually quite fascinating often hypnotic
 and most of the songs are short enough that they come to an end long before they
 cease to be interesting
 
 bastien speaks to the hints of inevitability in his music choosing palindromes
 for the titles to each of his songs the titles he says reflect the way these
 little machines function whether they are read forwards or backwards they are
 understood the same way and this coming or going of wordsnotes can be imagined
 as an infinite cycle
 
 tender red net is a calm peaceful number that begins as a duet between bastien
 on organ and a machine playing marimbas as it moves on we hear various clankings
 in the background rhythmic record scratches and the soothing melody of lowpitched
 strings revolt lover features bastien on prepared trumpet and bass while his
 robots manipulate records suggesting that he puts just as much thought into his
 own arrangements as those of his machines on deep speed bastien mics the
 machines themselves and arranges their movements into a rhythm which accompanies
 a machine playing casiotone and bastiens jazzedup trumpet riffs
 
 no doubt many will dismiss this album as a gimmick which is a damned shame the
 music made by bastien and his robot band is every bit as delicate and unique as
 the methods by which it was created these machines never give up and bastien
 promises to keep working with them who knows what sort of music hell be able to
 create as his machines continue to evolve and if we ever see a robot rights
 movement theres no telling what might happendespite the ramblings of armchair philosophers and fanatical pseudoluddites a
 computer is not a cold inherently impersonal entity unlike more utilitarian
 electronic items calculators microwaves etc computers can be endowed by
 their owners with a sometimes startling degree of personality countless hours of
 work are often put into creating a computer that bears the characteristics of its
 owner or at least the characteristics that its owner wants it to possess
 
 and yet many people still seem to be reluctant to acknowledge that something
 warm organic and truly personal can emerge from the silicon belly of a powerbook
 especially when it comes to music journalists have been going on for ages about
 some pieces of wood molded metal and a few electromagnets being an extension of
 the penis whats so different about the concept of a laptop being an extension
 of the laptop no a computer cant be physically smacked around like a guitar
 or a set of drums but its nearly limitless potential for the creation and
 manipulation of sound makes it a perfect medium for uniquely personal music
im happy and im singing and a 1 2 3 4 is a collection of three
 tracks performed by jim orourke on his laptop computer in new york osaka and
 tokyo given the nature of these performances the record inhabits that squishy
 gray area somewhere between a composition and an improvisation since this is the
 first time these songs have been released its impossible to know how much of
 the album is premeditated
 
 the results of orourkes halfimprovisations are absolutely stunning im
 happy and im singing and a 1 2 3 4 is comprised of sounds too intricate
 and complex to be the product of spontaneous experimentation but unlike many
 albums consisting of such sounds this album moves at the speed of human thought
 developing in a subtle methodical yet never cold and technical manner changes
 happen slowly enough that you can fully take in every nuance yet nothing ever
 seems obvious
 
 im happy opens the record with nondescript glitchy sine waves playing a sparse
 quiet pattern that pattern swells to a buzzing mass of sound so dense that it
 seems to comprise a single melodic entity gradually orourke manipulates this
 one central sonic pillar adding sounds that vary slightly in melody and timbre
 and somehow he manages to keep im happy dense enough to be completely
 enveloping while still open enough to be noticeably transformed by every one of
 its individual voices about halfway through the track a series of subtle melodic
 changes and the addition of a humming bass drone drastically alter the character
 of the song though the elements comprising remain largely unchanged
 
 though im happy fades out with a few moments of dark ambience the following
 track and im singing showcases a more playful side of orourkes laptop
 opening with the stuttered sounds of a timer and chime and im singing then
 sees him using looped keyboards and synthesized sounds to create what could best
 be described as a single fragment of a gorgeous melody frozen in time strange
 ambiguous percussive sounds create a controlled cacophony until the song
 metamorphoses into a minimalistic arrangement of clean and distorted synthesized
 blips a single array of melodies is repeated developing so slowly that it can
 barely be noticed it then flows seamlessly into what could be the albums finest
 moment a progression of odd ambiguous sounds backed by distorted sine waves and
 acoustic guitar like its predecessor and im singing ends with a brief period
 of subdued ambience
 
 whereas im happy and and im singing often use a flurry of individual sounds
 to create the illusion tranquility and a 1 2 3 4 is much more sparse
 allowing the listener to focus more closely on every sound orourke uses and the
 sounds themselves are utterly gorgeous subtly manipulated strings that quiver
 and pulsate in slow sweeping gestures constantly arranging themselves into new
 harmonic patterns as more voices are added these patterns become more complex
 and more regular until the end of the song at which point orourke gently
 deconstructs the layers of sound that have been building for over fifteen minutes
 with the introduction of new thoroughly engaging sounds that function almost
 like a screen behind which the song can dismantle itself
 
 indeed im happy and im singing and a 1 2 3 4 despite its
 somewhat ridiculous title and its digital origins is a startlingly personal
 affecting album drawing as much on the fragile melodicism of folk music as the
 technical manipulation of minimalism and considering the strength of the bond
 that can develop between a man and his machine this record may be orourkes
 most direct statement to dateindianapolis also derisively known as naptown isnt known
 for much sure the place has a couple of perennially mediocre
 sports franchises and a yearly drunken redneck gathering
 disguised as an auto race but thats about it its a place
 people pass through to get to someplace else its also a
 pretty weak place musically save for a few stalwart soldiers
 fighting the good fight
 
 but it wasnt always that way as this comp attests no longer
 should indy cling to such weak sources of musical renown as
 home of hardcore legends the zero boys not when they can
 lay claim to the highlighters band in fact the citys
 visitors bureau and chamber of commerce would play highlighters
 singles in their lobbies if the knew what was up and theyd
 have plaques on their walls reading indianapolis the city
 that inspired bay area dj par excellence peanut butter wolf
 to put together one of the greatest funk comps ever
 
 the story goes like this while on a crosscountry bowling
 excursion thats right and record search wolf stopped in
 naptown and was introduced to highlighters sax player clifford
 palmer palmer played wolf some of his bands old 45s and wolf
 was so taken by them that he decided his next project for
 stones throw his label which put out madlibs quasimoto and
 yesterdays new quintet projects among others would be a
 massive old school funk comp
 
 and its damn good compiled with a curators eye for detail
 from the pacing of the tracks to the meticulous liner notes
 and what incredible range of styles hard funk smooth soul
 funk jazz funk instrumentals shoutouts antidrug anthems
 positive ghetto jams and every kind of postjb funk you can
 imagine seventyplus minutes all recorded between 1968 and
 1974 though most of its from between 7072
 
 to be fair not all the bands here are from indianapolis just
 the best of the batch the aforementioned highlighters give
 the comp its title with their titular contribution which
 tries to outjames brown james brown and comes as close as
 humanly possible then theres billy ball and the upsetters
 featuring roosevelt matthews with tighten up tighter and
 its supercharged booker t groove the ebony rhythm band who
 provide the comp with excellent intro and outro excerpts and
 radio djgonefunkbandleader spider harrison with the
 lurching syncopation of beautiful day
 
 of the nonindy bands there are several standouts but the
 most surprising is bad medicine made up of a bunch of white
 guys from upstate new york their trespasser is what you
 might call canonical funk after hearing it when you hear
 the word funk this will be the sound you imagine its
 pristine and by the books but deadon perfect there are
 two texas bands with killer cuts too dallas soul seven
 whose conservatory skills present maybe the hardest rawest
 funk of the lot and houstons kashmere stage band who take
 the big band approach to funk
 
 if theres a problem with the funky 16 corners its
 that its exhausting to listen to all the way through the
 energy is kept at such a level that its best to break it
 down into two or three sessions dont try and take it in
 all at once youll collapsei once saw tom snyder interview pat sajak pat was deliciously
 sarcastic exhibiting a dunedry sense of humor and scalpel wit
 rarely hinted at in his onair demeanor snyder eventually
 goaded sajak into telling viewers the stupidest thing hed ever
 heard a contestant say sajak smiled mischievously and told
 the story of a woman who faced with the following puzzle
 araham incon enthusiastically chirped abraham bincoln
 
 snyder and sajak had a good chuckle over this like the burbank
 tv bastards they are and moved on to some vaguely tawdry
 discussion of vanna white or something anyway after hearing
 psychedelicate for the third or fourth time it occurred
 to me that this would be pretty terrible music to listen to
 before a test before taking the stand as a witness or before
 a job interview the albums disorientingly lush sound does
 to your mind what the invisible protagonist of that old hellen
 keller joke does to her living room walks in moves shit
 around and leaves you bumping misplaced couches and sitting
 on toilet plungers if youre not careful it could have you
 guessing bincoln over and over
 
 yes motor city damsels the slumber party have put together a
 lovely codeine and absinthetinged pop platter that should
 put a stupid happy smile on your face even as it puts you to
 sleep if your mom had been the coolest mom on the block she
 might have sung you these tunes as lullabies
 
 alicia bergs children if she has any might someday boast of
 having had the coolest mom on the block her airy voice is the
 focal point of slumber partys music and her melodies keep
 things charmingly soporific bergs voice is like a less nasal
 nico minus the euroaccent and thankfully free of that
 existential misery the velvets singer was so obsessed with
 
 drowsiness is the main side effect of slumber partys music
 whod have thought but theres much for the alert mind to
 enjoy here matthew smith of the volebeats and outrageous
 cherry produced this reverbparty of an album and his sonic
 stewardship is even and expert the album never jars and one
 scarcely notices the transitions from kit drums to casiobeats
 instead concentrating on the constant dialogue between bergs
 vocal lines and gretchen gonzales meandering guitar work
 
 bag of spiders and everyone else i know the latter of
 which sounds a bit like a lowbudget stereolab are the
 albums standouts then again all the songs are fairly good
 if basically interchangeable the velvet underground and the
 vocal delivery of mazzy stars hope sandoval are the usual
 sonic touchstones in describing slumber partys music neither
 example however comes especially close to the mark theres
 a bouncy optimism and space to these songs that defy references
 to older darker material so what if the title sounds like one
 of those insipid before and after puzzles on wheelremember those two goth girls you knew back in high school
 you know the ones who hung out at the mall on weekends
 drinking starbucks coffee and eating mcdonalds well
 perdition city the new album from christophorus g
 rygg and tore yiwizaker aka ulver is a lot like that were
 talking lite gothindustrial mixed with smoothjazz and lame
 electronic music the kind so bad its actually deserving of
 the derogatory term often used by chain music stores
 electronica in other words total and utter crap
 
 to be fair the first few seconds of perdition city
 offers some potential the first track lost in moments
 opens with a driving drummachine beat heavily treated in
 reverb reminiscent of the sort that often found its way into
 early 70s psychedelia after about 20 seconds of this the
 beat drops out and its contrasted with a few sparse piano
 chords and random vocals likely from an illtuned radio
 in the distance alls well so far and then comes the
 saxophone guest musician rolf erik nystrom plays sax with
 the schmaltziest of them which to be fair is a perfect
 match for the vocals wouldbesavvy seductive male crooning
 that briefly flirts with the idea of carrying the song before
 mercifully disappearing again as the sax thankfully leaves
 with the vocals the drum machine and piano return but even
 in this new context they sound plastic and uninspired by the
 time the song draws to a close with ominous minor chords
 whooshing windsounds and a cracklyvoiced narration you have
 to wonder how anyones supposed to take this seriously
 
 even more laughable are the liner notes which if one can
 wade through the pretentious nonsense like i know now that
 the underworld is incalculable to describe it we rely
 exclusively on tones sounds rhythm and pure instrumentality
 divulge that these guys consider coil an influence excuse me
 while i retreat to a corner and snicker to myself loud enough
 that people on the other side of the room can hear
 
 what these guys dont seem to realize is that layering some
 creepy vocals ghosts presence ghost music from the radio
 at night and you cant sleep over a vaguely ambient backdrop
 that sounds like an amateur rendition of who will fall as
 they do on snicker snicker we are the dead does not
 make you coil it makes you a coil ripoff a blatant one
 you see ulver makes music that is dark and ominous
 without actually posing any legitimate threat not unlike
 those two girls you knew back in high school
 
 really i cant even begin to comprehend how anyone who listens
 to coil could release music this corny and live with themselves
 coil is legitimately frightening ulver is frightening like a
 madefortv horror movie is frightening ulver makes music for
 people who want to convince themselves that they dig creepy
 music without ever having to worry about nervously glancing
 over their shoulder or feeling their pulse rise
 
 for christs sake on catalept they actually sample bernard
 herrmanns theme from psycho sorry guys but after busta
 rhymes uses it it no longer falls into the creepy category
 furthermore the creepiest music in the world generally ceases
 to be creepy when attached to a drummachine beat that for all
 intents and purposes might be named demo
 
 still im all about giving credit where credit is due and i
 must give ulver points for variety according to their website
 rygg and yiwizaker hail from the norwegian metal scene pinning
 perdition city as something of a departure from their
 norm even among the tracks on the album the duo tries out a
 few different styles besides the pseudoindustrial tracks
 theres also hallways of always a lame excursion into the
 world of casiobased electronics and porn piece or the scars
 of cold kisses which takes a stab at bad adultcontemporary
 balladry and disguises it with casiobased electronics
 
 who knows maybe perdition city was nothing more than a
 wellintentioned but ultimately illadvised experiment for
 these guys maybe in their more traditional form ulver is a
 really solid metal band if thats the case well you cant
 blame a band for trying something different that said ulver
 might want to consider a return to their metal roots if i
 want to hear something creepy ill stick to the real thingthe first time i listened to this album i seriously considered
 writing this review as a single runon sentence this is
 after all music that drones on and on with nary a single bit
 of punctuation to be found in fact on first listen i didnt
 make it past the second track but as im dutybound to
 actually listen to everything i review i spun it again a few
 days later with the volume up some and it revealed itself to
 be well not so terrible i couldnt take it in one sitting
 seven listens later im a bit divided on what to tell you
 about charity empressas selftitled debut album i suppose
 starting with some background couldnt hurt so ill offer
 this for you to chew on while i gather my thoughts charity
 empressa is a twoman unit comprised of eric campuzano of the
 lassie foundation assisted by a guy who goes by the frank
 lenz foundation theyre helped out by a wideranging cast
 of guest vocalists and instrumentalists though its never
 made very clear who contributes what or even what some of the
 musicians play in passing ill mention that charity
 empressa are openly and forthrightly christian but it barely
 matters as only one moment on the whole record even evidences
 that fact
charity empressa begins with a series of layered
 vacuumpacked drones and some new age keyboards that are
 initially rather pleasant this is a nice intro you think
 easing back in your chair the only problem is that an intro
 needs a song to be a part of and most introductions arent
 over four minutes long a pall of hazy reverb and drones
 hangs as though dead daubed with noodling on the brightly
 toned keyboard even the programmed drum beat that comes in
 near the end doesnt make it more interesting hell you
 cant even hear it if you dont have your stereo turned up
 loud enough by the time they actually decide to shift the
 overall texture youve stopped listening the shift doesnt
 really lead to a higher gear either and the song just kind
 of evaporates ironically theyve chosen to title the song
 are we there yet
 the second track carew answers that question by saying no
 but heres a trumpet over basically the same foundation
 guest trumpeter matt fronke does his best 1969 miles davis
 impression and to his credit its the third most interesting
 thing on the entire album the main problem occurs when you
 realize that he isnt really playing much of a theme rather
 hes simply wandering in a droning wasteland of shimmery
 texture shortened to thirty seconds this would have made a
 fine outro to an early verve bside but here it just drags
 on and on
 future king of england adds some heavily phased vocals from
 wayne fernandez everett everetts sense of key is interpretive
 at best and the whole thing plays largely like a tribute to
 the haunting vocal break of godspeed you black emperors
 providence slathered in a big silky drone its pretty
 and all but why it lasts over six minutes is beyond me
 considering that by then its exhausted its welcome three
 times over
 this brings us to the second most interesting moment on this
 album the vaguely eastern may the good lord find you a
 steady tabla beat chugs away in the background marching
 through a mist of that same drone that covers everything else
 guest vocalist raquel munoz offers a decent melody for the
 first time on the record and the song is actually short
 enough not to grow tiresome any renewed interest is quickly
 squelched however by give em hell 10xbd minutes of drone
 that services their own titles request at first the drone
 is mixed with some fairly neat static and somewhat regular
 hand percussion moves in and out of the background at a few
 points but theres virtually nothing to justify the songs
 length in the end the swelling hum comes across about as
 interesting as an academic demonstration of an early fm
 synthesizer
 the crush of the mountains is only slightly more interesting
 and this is due to vocalist matt kelly whose multitracked
 melody saves it from allout numbing boredom but does little
 to contour it thankfully its followed by what is far and
 away the best thing charity empressa have to offer a unique
 track called shake your money maker the song samples a
 1939 recording by the albert francis trio of a song called
 the risen savior and the rhythm maker taken from the
 library of congress archives at less than three minutes
 its the perfect length and the backing provided by the band
 for the sample is unusually vibrant and rhythmic funky
 little bass figures dance around busily tapping rhythms and
 the drones though present are kept largely to a minimum
 of the remaining four songs only one stands out at all
 stay gold follows the same drone blueprint adding a little
 bit of guitar which inevitably merges with the rest of the
 background cool as cranes is an ephemeral wisp of a song
 buried deep in stationary drones breathing is good which
 is largely the same thing with a female vocalist is equally
 brief and inconsequential finally closer the kool kids and
 rok and roll comes in with some strong male vocals an actual
 bassline and some maracas to keep time initially there
 are no drones at all and the first one to enter is provided
 not by big gauzy echoing synths but an organ the lyrics
 are quaint referencing the mc5 and the rolling stones and
 calling on god to bless rock and roll of course by the
 songs end its enveloped once again by big drony synths
 and it ends sounding much like it began listless and
 unobtrusive
 and with that the disc is over and we come to the reason im
 so divided on what to say about this album i actually like
 the sound of it a lot but it never takes that intriguing
 sound and does enough with it for me likewise i know there
 are people out there who will lap this up quite enthusiastically
 if youre into drone outfits like stars of the lid for example
 theres probably a lot to like for you about charity empressa
 however for me this record simply doesnt succeed on most
 levels and thats all ive got to saythe bevis frond emerged fullyformed from the skull of british
 rock a cult favorite ever since nick saloman created the band
 in the 80s it has stayed with a heavy 60sstyle psychedelic
 sound resisting all britpop fashion and trends over the
 years the frond has grown from a oneman band recording in a
 bedroom to a trio that works in an actual studio but listening
 to the first few records now back in print thanks to rubric
 records its surprising to hear how little the man has
 changed
 
 as shown on the fronds third album triptych saloman
 has always had a mature unpretentious and frankly drugfree
 sensibility under all the exotica and period sounds he makes
 what is at its core meatandpotatoes rock modern audiences
 can dig the quirks and humor without hearing addled lyrics
 about how far away the singers hand looks at the end of his
 arm saloman employs eloquent leftfield imagery to address
 concrete sometimes mundane subjects getting old going to
 court dealing with the old man who owns the guitar shop and
 his swaggerfree voice and genuine english accent lend the
 wordplay conviction
 
 every song has a great hook or riff and salomans guitar sears
 across these lofi recordings the solos jam icicles in your
 eyeballs the riffs slam your solar plexus the few long jams
 stick to fundamentals and eschew freeform noodling he sounds
 like he could go on forever yet he manages to stop before you
 feel like checking your watch
triptych was originally selfreleased by saloman in 1988
 and he took a few liberties with the recording he gave his
 fouryearold daughter a percussion feature shes okay he
 invited his mum to sing on his cover of hey joe shes
 brilliant only david letterman has put a mother to better
 use in the service of art on the other hand the two
 instrumentals just fill space album opener into the cryptic
 myst a bland relic that does nothing but set the mood and
 phil exorcises the daemons a short piece with drummer phil
 collyer that never takes off
 
 around those tangents sit some of the fronds best pop songs
 lights are changing rides on a byrdslike riff and a catchy
 chorus mary lou lord almost had a hit with her cover of this
 song but her glossy nicegirl spin on the tune cant compare
 to this raw original where saloman pushes his vocals higher
 than they can comfortably go its followed by more fine
 retropop saloman splays killer riffs and a twoguitar attack
 across gemini machine and nowhere fast while the ballads
 old man blank and corinthian have gentle vocals and
 classic flower power organ lines
 
 the album closes with hey joe and six catchy but inessential
 bonus tracks theyre a breath of cool air after the centerpiece
 of the album tangerine infringement beak a twentyminute
 oneman jam session that saloman plays like the four horsemen
 of garage rock sprawling and unruly it treads perilously
 near total indulgence but closer inspection reveals that the
 song is neatly organized into sections and paced for maximum
 effect and when saloman runs out of lyrics he admits it and
 segues to the threeminute organnoise coda very sensiblesongs for cassavetes is a documentary about indie rock
 shot on 16mm blackandwhite film stock and featuring live
 show footage of bands largely from washington dc andor
 washington state it likely features some live footage arty
 yet organic camera work and scenes of witty articulate
 attractively disheveled indie rockers selfconsciously mugging
 at the camera and talking about touring i say likely because
 well i havent seen it the film is currently on tour and
 may be coming to your town soon it wont be coming to mine
 though i live in rural north carolina thus my options for
 catching the film are limited to my coughing up the price of
 a dvd no thanks or waiting for that friendly guy with the
 dog at broadway video to stock it am i disappointed not
 really i mean i nearly broke my neck trying to see the
 dismissable halfcocked way back in the day only to
 learn that rodan cant act no surprises
 
 also i received via first class mail the soundtrack from
 songs for cassavetes which does in fact feature
 fifteen or so primarily live tracks from bands like
 sleaterkinney dub narcotic sound system and the makeup
 interspersed throughout are witty articulate selfconscious
 quips from people like molly neuman and calvin johnson about
 doing what you love and what happened to the underground in
 the 90s which provide nice audio accompaniment to the
 blackandwhite still frames on the cover and the earnest
 quotations from filmmaker justin mitchell in the liners
 example what follows is the kind of moment one never
 forgets you know the kind that ends up defining a part of
 your life and that you end up always trying to recapture for
 the next ten minutes youre someplace its pretty close to
 bliss and you know everyone else in the room feels the same
 thing
 
 theres no denying the good intentions and fortunately
 songs for cassavetes largely avoids falling victim to
 the typical fate of good intentions this isnt a sinkorswim
 release and id be willing to bet that if you buy this you
 have a pretty good idea of what itll sound like before you
 even get to the cash register that of course may be a
 problem for a project dedicated to showcasing the innovation
 of the indie rock scene there are few risks im betting for
 example that even if youre not a fan youve heard
 sleaterkinneys words and guitars and ill bet you have a
 pretty good idea of how that sounds live raw endearingly
 unskilled likewise the live version of unwounds arboretum
 makes a compelling argument for just how tight unwound is but
 doesnt build much on the lp version the live recording format
 is even less effective for bands like the makeup and dub
 narcotic whose onstage success derives in part from the
 comparative performing charisma of their frontmen
 
 the lesserknowns put up a good show furthers i am a
 stranger is a great little garagey retro pop gem whose
 psychedelic leanings foreshadow certain bandmembers futures
 in the beachwood sparks likewise chisels featuring the
 once and future ted leo spectacles which according to
 liner apocrypha served as partial genesis for the entire
 project has something of a jawbox feel
 
 im not so sure this soundtrack is strong enough to stand
 alone without knowledge of the film the soundbytes from the
 interviews set a tone lots of diy spirit and the john
 cassavetes quotation thats attributed to everyone provides
 some input as to the chosen title i was darkly saddened to
 learn that it was not a collective answer to le tigres
 whats yr take on cassavetes but ultimately all these
 bands have stronger material excepting perhaps the hifives
 whose fizzy ingratiating you can is the clear winner for
 low point on this cd
 
 not a bad collection but unsurprisingly no surprisessebastien tellier a 25yearold musician from paris france
 bears an unfortunate physical resemblance to richard reid a
 28yearold shoebomber from london england luckily the
 resemblance ends with the face for whereas reid desires
 explosive death and destruction tellier only desires sleep
 or so it seems telliers debut lp lincroyable vrit
 on airs new label record makers aims at sounding lonely
 it attains its desired measure of solitude and regrettably
 much much worse
 at first i thought the opening track oh malheur chez omalley
 was the theme music from dr who this judgment of course
 was patently unfair and premature had i exercised patience i
 would have realized that in actuality it was actually from
 land of the lost say marshall its getting dark outside
 wed better get back before the fuck no not the sleestaks
 aside from not fully understanding what the hell a sleestak
 was the tall greenishyellow lizard men that populated the
 land of the lost fear of them always seemed pitifully
 irrational to me yes they bullrushed marshall will and
 holly with nocturnal regularity but can we be sure they
 intended harm after all sleestaks werent known for their
 leaping abilities or catlike reflexes perhaps sleestaks just
 liked to give hugs can anyone really be sure lucky for us
 tellier provides an answer to this stone age mystery towards
 the end of the album
 sleestaks aside for the moment the point remains a good
 chunk of this frenchmans first lp draws on the anachronistic
 hues of scifi television and other 60s70s era theme music
 as on the frivolous kazoo iii including weird organ vamps
 and rudimentary synth arrangements the rest of the album bucks
 the scifi thing in favor of arpeggiated acoustic guitar
 boredom with ambient clinks and clatter in the background
 and occasionally humming or singing from the artist himself
 tellier sets the machine in motion and it goes and goes and
 goes songs blend together like days in hell
 but back to the staks the albums high point comes when
 tellier appears to answer the aforementioned mystery on
 trilogie femme a largely somnolent sologuitar tune part
 of which is oddly reminiscent of the pitterpatter plucking
 sounds of bugs bunny walking on his tippytoes but in this
 case its clearly not bugs no the mood is too dark and
 foreboding these are the tones not of the animated thespian
 but of the scaly doomsayer alas a womans chilling screams
 of horror conclude the tune and the resolution becomes as
 clear as crystal gravy she was killed by sleestaks vicious
 tiptoeing sleestaks it happens
 but besides allowing me several glorious sleestak references
 lincroyable vrit is nearly worthless good luck
 distinguishing lonely telliers candlelight drones from one
 another and any other element of the powerful emotions he
 was supposedly aiming for lincroyable vrit is
 virtually devoid of melody climax or even compelling
 orchestration which usually can save slow moody music like
 telliers and even though its not quite as scary as
 maneating prehistoric reptiles lincroyable vrit
 evokes about the same response avoidancei recently succumbed to temptation and purchased one of those
 premium cable packages rationalizing it as a vital and
 illuminating cultural window as i surfed around hoping to
 find something that would truly justify my reasoning aside
 from the 40 cooking channels i came across mark kitchells
 oscarnominated documentary berkeley in the sixties
 though the film explored a number of topics its theme seemed
 to suggest that the counterculture revolution of the 60s was
 prone to fail because it lacked a single coherent vision of
 what the postrevolutionary world should be comprised of
 
 having no firsthand experience with the 60s i instead drew
 parallels from my knowledge of the infinetly more profitoriented
 seattlewave of the early 90s both were adorned with seemingly
 anticommercial sentiments which were flagrantly touted and
 oftprofessed yet rarely put into action and both seemed to
 coincide with a burgeoning musical movement but by the 90s
 artists were well aware of the price their insolence afforded
 them and the few who took up the cause basically signed their
 own death warrants
 
 subtly advertising commercialism and all things
 counterproductive worked their way from the barroom to
 the concert hall and finally into your local indie venue
 eventually most artists and clubs were perfectly willing to
 offer coke the chance to equate their soda with an enjoyable
 social event for the right amount of funding luckily as the
 old guard died away a line of new blood was slowly
 consolidating their power refusing to dilineate between
 music and politics
 
 a few years ago belle and sebastian perhaps better known as
 the thorn in the ass of the industry took the highminded
 ranting of naomi klein and karl marx to the next level and
 organized the bowlie weekender an attempt to remedy the
 recent corporate transgresses while also avoiding the common
 pratfalls that seem to marr similar efforts the bowlie
 weekender was a threeday festival held in pontins camber
 sands sussex where performers of a similar ideology such
 as godspeed you black emperor mogwai the pastels the
 flaming lips mercury rev and sleaterkinney convened with
 their fans free of advertisements press and all the
 trappings of a commercial event when the festival was
 reprised in 2000 its name had been changed to all tomorrows
 parties but the environs and intent remained the same
 
 2002 will see the marriage of belle and sebastians brainchild
 with american sensibility as for three days in march los
 angeles will be the ironic home of atp now the orchestrators
 of that event have independently produced compiled and distributed
 an album featuring primarily rare and unreleased tracks from
 many of the artists who contributed to the festival all said
 theres something kinda beautiful about the whole thing
 
 the disc commences with sonic youths fauxhemians a musical
 ode to fellow festival curators tortoise sonic youths
 decadespanning kneejerk reaction to daydream nation
 has left many heads good and scratched and if you havent
 given up on another dirty sister or evol
 yet accepting the truth is the first step on your road to
 recovery the rest of us can sleep a little easier tonight
 though as fauxhemians does what nyc ghosts and flowers
 failed to go somewhere similarly formerpunks turned
 knobtwiddlers unwound contribute the enthralling behold the
 salt a testament to the emotional scope their music has come
 to encompass since corpse pose so far theres nothing but
 an early morning breeze wafting throughout these tracks
 
 stephen malkmus makes an appearance with good kids egg
 further cementing his reputation as a bottomless oasis of
 insightful wit after ten years his patented offkilter voice
 can still pull off lines like do what the good kids do and
 screw who the good screw a million of us came here with
 our pockets turned out elsewhere cannibal ox contributes
 pidgeon off last years excellent the cold vein
 such a diverse selection of styles generally gives rise to
 needless continuity complications but in this instance the
 dynamic created by the contrasting genres is what lends the
 album so much of its bent appeal
 
 stereolab have performed at every atp since its inception and
 theyre represented here with old lungs which finds the
 bands more experimental side remarkably healthy a relief to
 those whove longed for a return to the days of transient
 randomnoise bursts with announcements cat powers cover
 of the robert johnson classic come on in my kitchen finds
 chan marshalls milky vocals breathing a sense of life into
 lyrics which have had some 80 years to decompose and papa m
 follows suit with the heartwrenching how can i tell you i
 love you
 
 but to say that this disc is a sugarysweet affair is to miss
 some of the albums most rewarding tracks early on bardo
 pond indicate that all is not well in the world of demographic
 evasion as they indulge in dispensing poetry over a free
 arrangement of guitar drums and bass but its the latter
 half of the disc which features dead c the boredoms kevin
 drumm and satans tornade unleashing an avantnoise maelstrom
 of epic proportions that truly makes the album worth owning
 dead cs sonic collage of dissonant mechanical noise field
 recordings abstract flourishes of percussion and feedback
 on load segment are all coated with an ethereal reverb
 slightly muting what would otherwise be a very confrontational
 track
 
 yet as the disarming ambience of load segment slowly
 dissolves the boredoms begin to interject the peace with
 shards of skeletal whitenoise before establishing the chaotic
 tribal beat of super are which sustains its incontinence
 for over ten minutes only to collapse into the crass and
 callous arms of kevin drumms my tree bears no nuts part 2
 drumm and likeminded composer satans tornade work like a
 more schizophrenic merzbow sharply cutting layering and
 varying the tone of their sonic exorcisms daring the listener
 to find the hidden rhythm to their madness all of this can
 make for a very intense introspective assault depending on
 the listeners level of participation
 
 theres a sense of nihilistic isolation permeating the surface
 of the songs compiled on all tomorrows parties v11
 even the albums happiest moments are mired in feelings of
 regret or unrequited desire as records go its far abovepar
 and should provide you with hours of consolation and enjoyment
 but if the disc is meant to act as a mission statement its
 intended message seems to be stick with coke man youll be
 a lot fucking happiersetting small office in small apartment in small provincial town
 
 time martin luther king day this year
 
 at rise hapless reviewer female about age twentysix sits at desk drinking
 illadvised coffee on mostly empty stomach and quickly filling an ashtray she
 stares helplessly at a computer screen and contemplates a pastelhued cd cover
 the sound of sentimental folkpop plays softly in the background
 
 hapless reviewer sighs lights cigarette should a band be derided if
 their music appears in an episode of a heavily scorned teen drama on the wb
 
 her conscience enters from stage left takes a seat in the broken yellow
 chair in the corner this again
 
 hapless reviewer yeah so
 
 her conscience no they shouldnt otherwise decent bands have appeared on
 teen dramas before remember when the flaming lips played on 90210
 
 hapless reviewer but what if appearing on a wb soundtrack is the bands single
 greatest though dubious claim to fame
 
 her conscience still thats pretty harsh lights cigarette
 incidentally how do you know that
 
 hapless reviewer i typed their name into a search engine and dawsons creek
 showed up
 
 her conscience oh is it any good
 
 hapless reviewer i dunno a little contrived hard to believe they really sound
 like that naturally the girl in particular i could see how it might be a
 guilty pleasure and im guessing the fanbase is predominately female but
 personally i think its kind of boring and a little too selfconsciously
 precious for its own good
 
 her conscience are you talking about the show
 
 hapless reviewer oh god no the band rilo kiley from los angeles
 
 her conscience how does it sound
 
 hapless reviewer well you can hear it for yourself this is the first song go
 ahead it has that airy fingerpicked folk thing going on pretty i guess but
 the most typical chord progression in the world and the girl jenny lewis
 sings in that breathy pouty little girl way favored by far too many female
 singersongwriters these days i hate that she adds backing harmonies to give
 herself a little more substance but its hard to take someone seriously when
 they sing if you wanna have your cake and eat it too and if you want to have
 other people watch while you eat it go ahead its not quite campy enough to be
 twee like its a tad more upbeat than ida but less interesting musically
 
 her conscience thats not a compliment is it
 
 hapless reviewer not really no and i feel sort of bad pointing this out rilo
 kiley is kind of a new band and all but this sounds really amateurish pictures
 of success could be a prom band doing ida with all the problems that implies
 you know the questionable sound quality slightly outoftune instrumentation
 including a completely irrelevant trumpet line at the end overarticulated
 vocals and an unnatural gentleness that makes you feel a little bit embarrassed
 pause jenny lewis vocals really drive me crazy
 
 her conscience well what about this other singer
 
 hapless reviewer yeah thats blake sennett he sounds a lot like elliott smith
 but not as good still its an improvement over the girl otherwise this song
 is fairly dismissable you know how some bands can take the whole 60s litepop
 sound and subvert it to amusing andor ironic effect not these kids its like
 muzak the beatlesesque business on small figures in a vast expanse isnt so
 bad i guess i think the guitars sound better there than they usually do and
 i actually find that i dont mind jenny lewis vocals so much when theyre
 overdubbed as backing vocals
 
 her conscience have we heard this song before
 
 hapless reviewer no it just sounds the same except track ten always its
 not a bad song i like the new wave intro i like how overthetop pop it is and
 that its comparatively loud reminds me of velocity girl back in the day and
 im inclined to believe this is the direction rilo kiley should take but still
 
 her conscience youre going to make fun of them arent you for that dawsons
 creek business
 
 hapless reviewer its such a temptation its not worth it though i cant
 get a good dig in at rilo kiley because theyre not bad enough to warrant my ire
 im not offended just bored the worst thing i could say is that this is
 forgettable and any humor i may find in their connection to dawsons creek will
 do little more than remind me of who they aremost things dont change time passes and ideas about things change but the
 actual nature of things stays pretty much the same this is a phenomenon that
 while never a popular train of thought among the superhip and tunedin is
 almost always the final resting place for great thinkers and your grandparents
 alike and of course theres a constant subversive debate over whether or not
 this is really the case some people will say that the idea of a static
 environment is contrary to the nature of culture and in fact nature itself
 and then theres the issue of evolution both theoretical and biological these
 are all heavy philosophical arguments but if you just ask your grandparents
 youll find that in actuality nothing has changed and if anything the state
 of the world is regressing
 now this debate becomes extra troublesome for us the people who care about music
 above all other concerns because often the appearance of not changing is
 viewed negatively you need look no further than pitchforks review
 archive to find that informed music thinkers often dismiss the new when it isnt
 chiefly when an artist seems not to have advanced to the next square in the
 music game the artist risks being accused of resting on his laurels or worse
 making the reviewer bored and as we all know a bored music critic is a crime
 against nature
 i dont have a big problem with stuff staying the same at least to a point after
 all if artists didnt go back to their roots as if they had a choice theyd
 never be able to build upon them englands cylob aka chris jeffs is building
 on roots with mood bells to my ears hes playing either ambient or new
 age music here and though neither of those terms may leave the best of impressions
 on some listeners theyre certainly valid avenues of expression yes i think
 the music here could have come from the 70s 80s or 90s and perhaps that means
 its not a revolutionary concept in art but its also not a real criticism in my
 opinion what will warrant criticism is dependent on your reaction to those roots
 do you like new age so with that out of the way lets proceed with the album
 at hand
 tamtam intro begins the album with no hint of irony as its essentially a gong
 splash and thats it the next tune is majorette which is a meditative figure
 played on bells its quite short as are all the songs on mood bells
 and features no embellishment or variation on the figure its the kind of music
 that i would play as a soundtrack to staring because there arent any bumps in
 the road or rough transitions if that sounds like a compliment then chances are
 you will like this record if not stay tuned
 china gong introduces a couple of new timbres chiefly that of well a
 highpitched chinese gong like you hear in chinese opera and some kind of
 metallic mallet instrument this isnt so much a song as a vignette of
 percussive textures dark days brings in a scalar melody but keeps the
 instrumentation from the previous tune intact sometimes the pitches shift
 up or down unnaturally like you can do on keyboards with the little pitchshifter
 handle though apparently they are honesttogod bells if a bit manipulated
 digitally
 sunday introduces more familiar synthlines and perhaps wouldnt sound out of
 place on bjrks last album however bjrk would probably use this kind of thing
 for an intro and then begin a proper song again cylobs music on this album is
 more effective as disembodied ambience than active listening experience so its
 probably best not to go in expecting fireworks
 the only tune that features so much as a beat is snowing though it is suitably
 restrained fans of cylobs previous ambient techno stuff will probably enjoy
 this release but then fans of cylobs previous more rambunctious material
 especially stuff like 1997s cylobs latest effort ep may be put off by
 the sheer passiveness of the music i couldnt really call myself a fan of
 nearbeatless ambient per se but by the same token this disc did make a great
 companion to writing and just looking out of my window last weekendyour humble reviewer is not hugely invested in the state or the fate of hiphop
 a lot of folks are though sometimes to an unfortunate extent hiphop spends
 almost as much time drawing lines and fighting over its own image as the punk and
 hardcore zines do albeit more entertainingly one of the results of this is that
 a whole lot of hiphop records are basically about hiphop the mainstream stuff
 aka real hiphop offers up further metaexplorations of a few mcpersona
 archetypes while the undie stuff aka real hiphop dedicates itself to the
 ancient skillz of cratedigging battle rhyming and either picking on the
 mainstream or spitting abstract jumbles of wordplay the former is how we get
 stuff like p diddy saying i dont write rhymes i write checks the latter
 is how we get stuff like the antipop consortium who sound godlike in ten second
 snippets but prove mindnumbingly tedious by fifteen
 
 aesop rock is one of those mcs who have stumbled upon a blindingly intelligent
 solution to this state of affairs hes ignored all of that baggage and made a
 record thats mostly about something that something is work labor effort in
 its broadest sense is a topic he treats sometimes pedantically but often
 more thoughtprovokingly than not only the bulk of hiphop but the bulk of any
 genre it helps that labor days is as terrific a record as anyone could
 ask for really and you should buy it and heres why
 
 first aesop rock is a terrific mc his flow is rapid but clear his interjections
 doubletime verses and singsong bits are arranged with nearsymphonic skill
 hes also calm and confident avoiding both the egomaniacal swagger of a lot of
 mainstream and the egomaniacal jerkiness of a lot of underground while nicking
 their finer points as well better than that aesop rocks flow is brilliant a
 combination of mindbending wordplay who am i he asks then answers
 jabberwocky superfly inrhymed poetics you wont be laughing when the
 buzzards drag your brothers flags to rags and surgically sharp eyerolling
 dismissals of anyone he disapproves of if you had one more eye youd be a
 cyclops runs one which may explain your missing the premise aesop rock says
 more astoundingly intelligent things per minute than the entire combined rosters
 of a lot of other labels
 
 second blockhead who produces much of this record does an equally terrific job
 labor days is bound for constant comparisons to cannibal oxs the cold
 vein the other def jux edgy intelligent nyc mcs with stark progressive beats
 record to crop up on 2001s yearend lists and while the comparisons are valid
 ones lyrically and often sonically labor days differs by trading in
 the cold veins minimalist grind for an equally minimal but remarkably
 lush cinematic spread of subtly weaving beats and sinuous somber minorkey
 instrumental arrangements that sound as if someone has been doing his
 cratedigging in the klezmer bouzouki and koto piles of the world classical
 section
 
 daylight the records initial standout works from a long plush melodic loop
 with a wood flute sighing over it there are a lot of woody flutes on this record
 enough to make you wonder if blockhead wouldnt have done a better job than rza
 on the ghost dog soundtrack meanwhile save yourself the records
 real standout consists of a slowmotion lope constructed from staccato bass
 blips an eastmediterranean guitar pluck and wispy female cooing battery
 stretches the limits of hiphop pastoralism with a bassandcello figure and more
 of those fluttering coos with ace intoning brother sun sister moon mother
 beautiful and i painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids
 
 if most hiphop chases a futuristic brightly lit city vitality labor days
 is laid out peacefully on a rainy plain somewhere and if the cold vein
 sounds like the grind of inscrutable machinery labor days waits a couple
 hundred years for those machines to be covered with moss and vines when it all
 comes together on 95ers anthem a track which pairs a sprightly bassline
 with handbells handbells with ace in top form spitting out brilliant parallel
 metaphors for quotidian employment it seems so allconsumingly right hiphop
 bouncing confidently along actually saying something about something and
 saying it well and smartly
 
 aesop rock does have a message here which youd expect to be a bad thing
 but isnt really insofar as the message is a pretty reasonable one aces message
 is that life can be hard but thats all the more reason to shut your mouth and
 work on something that makes you happy essentially labor days gets
 cartoonish only once on no regrets which is still a decent and sensitive
 track but which we wont really get into here because on the other hand its the
 inherent pragmatism of aces theme that allows for his wonderfully apologetic
 complaints about 95 employment not to mention all those glorious eyerolling
 disses keep me posted he says as to when you grasp something mature to sit
 and soak about mister and ill consider picking up your record
 
 that last lines from save yourself which collects aces comments on the how
 we do hiphop question hes undie of course here with his sonically
 progressive def jux release so clearly hes going to drop some invective on
 this important issue his take though forget it maybe you ought to try saving
 something other than hiphop insightful advice no matter what genre you insert
 at the end pistons pump perfect he says then what youre holding aint
 really broken and for the duration of labor days its pretty clear
 that in the hands of someone with something to use it for its not not
 at allbefore there was iggy there was jim in the much recounted story iggy was still
 a jazz nerd when he saw the doors play at michigan states homecoming weekend
 dance morrison drunk and angry berated the thicknecks while pouring his
 loudest most annoying caterwauls over the din of his backing band unfortunately
 iggys stooges didnt have the chops to cut their blues so mean instead turning
 to the frantic diatribes of nonsense and noise that would become punk
 
 that early flirting with sensuality freud and slightly hokey if atmospheric
 leanings towards magic still resonates across america though it isnt so popular
 in the underground the music like morrison in his last days is commonly
 referred to as bloated it is therefore with some grace that black cat music
 summon the bravado freeassociative linguistics and raw confidence of the doors
 granted this is just one of many doors references made in a sea of postdoors
 reviews but its among the most overt with the shimmery backdoor blues pouring
 so effortlessly from these guys hands from berkeley black cat music includes
 members of the criminals and the receivers and here they reclaim the
 longforgotten glam overtones first defined in kim fowleys version of west coast

 from the first moment travis duttons guitar brands the songs as ginfueled
 metallic based grit theres no pauncy apologies or ironic doublespeak just
 curlended phrases of instruments and vocals working at first in opposition
 then in chorus
 
 songs like the chainsnatcher borrow from the gun clubs protohair
 pompousness in a way no east coast band ever could most perfect day ever
 undercuts this with an acoustic rhythm track and subtle doubletracked
 background vocals indicative not so much of radio production as that of a
 precise studio mind still the svenoniuslike swagger of singer brady no
 last name takes on earnest sometimes cliched sentimental properties without a
 hint of that disaffection so obvious in nation of ulysses or any of the new breed
 of political postpunkers its as if black cat music projecting the sonic
 nihilism of their ancestors cant help but wake to the sunshine and expect it
 all to come out alright
 
 black cat musics genuflection at the glamgonemetal mindset coupled with
 bradys husky vocals also manages to make room for lovely moments like the
 dirty penny a song whose dark spanish turns recall eric burdons animals
 while standing firmly in the timeless world of slammin solos and slick studios
 that said this isnt progress so much as a reenvisioning of history one where
 morrison never sizzled out where iggys gutter antics still smacked of glitter
 and where the politics of the threat and the flag were just so much white kid
 middleclass jivei cant really play the piano but i do know the basic i iv and v chords when
 i find myself in front of a keyboard and im with people who cant play its
 fun to improvise a little melody on this foundation i just do a walking bassline
 with my left hand and hit some random notes that fit with the chords with my
 right if i play slowly the little tune that spins out has an impressive
 melancholic quality considering the complete lack of skill and talent that went
 into it
 idyllictronic ryan make that royalty check out to simon reynolds bedroom
 producers carpet musics consisting of oregonians eric diaz and eric mast
 realize the strength that comes from simplicity the 14 tracks on their debut
 weekday are filled with these basic chord progressions gently tapped
 on dreamy synthesizers and guitars set to ambient with just a hint of
 distortion to reflect recent trends in glitch these tiny music box tunes are
 quite effective in their own modest way and the record as a whole sustains a
 mood and is consistently enjoyable still theres something just a bit too
 polite about weekday and the lack of tension keeps it from being great
 or even particularly memorable
 no its definitely not top 10 material though there are certain situations
 where this record would be perfect a gray day when your friends are out of town
 youre just getting over the flu and youre too broke to buy any new records
 would be the perfect time to hear dawn a track which reminds me of a
 strippeddown demo for schneider tms the light 3000 sans vocals the
 minutelong bathrobe has a palpable sadness not unlike some of the short
 transitional bits on boards of canadas music has the right to children
 afternoon is a continuation of the earlier noon a track with fingerpicked
 electric guitar and some gurgling synths that transforms itself into a dystrophic
 and adorable techno rhythm about 2xbd minutes in reminiscent of nobukazu
 takemuras work as childs view its an ideal track for relaxing on the couch
 as the sun fades away and you continue to wait for the mailman to bring that
 promised package of promo cds and fashion magazine with its 44 house thump
 and a clusterized melody ripped from the schlammpeitziger fakebook would set
 the mood for a shared cup of tea in a sunny kitchen a respite to talk intimately
 about the latest sonig releases
 theres not a thing wrong with functional music and thats how this record
 strikes me so while weekday keeps me at arms length emotionally it
 works so well as background that its worth keeping aroundi love the scene by the scene i mean music and the people who love it of
 course one overarching scene doesnt really exist more correctly there are
 hundreds of little scenes each of which contributes its own part to a greater
 whole the most common scene demarcation for obvious reasons is geography a
 bunch of bands and their fans in one city become a scene over time and in the
 right hands it nurtures creativity and collaboration
 of course when youve got several regional scenes rivalries begin to creep in
 over time these rivalries are usually nothing more than the imagined creations
 of a few fans or journalists but on occasion they spread to the business or
 rarely to the musicians themselves apparently the rivalry between the new
 york and chicago scenes has become real enough that new yorks selfstarter
 foundation makes a big deal over the fact that the detachment kit are a rare
 good band from chicago on their website regarding the bands signing
 regardless of your opinion of the chicago scene which we here at pitchfork
 most certainly do not have a problem with as our readers are fond of noting
 its quite the opposite its hard to argue with the fact that the detachment
 kit sounds a lot more like a new york band than a chicago one their jerky often
 melodic and occasionally even anthemic postpunk would sound right at home coming
 off the stage at cbgb on a bill with some rhode island school of design alumni
 in fact the detachment kit frequently sound as though they could be les savy favs
 younger brothers playing in their own band on their debut they raging quiet
 army guitaristvocalist ian menard comes across as something of a more
 melodic tim harrington while the rest of the band has their way with all manner
 of rhythmic interplay however the band manages to distance themselves enough
 from les savy fav that their music doesnt begin to sound like pale imitation
 on their own terms the detachment kit are an agile band that show a great deal
 of promise
 the band doesnt really turn in a single bad song here though a few stand
 especially tall above the crowd yourself a majesty of infinite space
 overflows with energy opening with canonical screaming and launching headlong
 into frenzied guitar lines and syncopated drumming that pay tribute to yet
 another scene dc menards multitracked voice is reminiscent of a less
 demented sounding guy picciotto spewing lines like now start the damage start
 the sound hurricane designed for people follows with stuttering verses and a
 kinetic sledgehammer of a chorus packed with piledriving bass and drums
 112263 typifies the les savy fav comparison perhaps better than any other song
 on the album with its slow start building to the explosive screaming of the
 chorus where menards similarity to harrington is more obvious than ever even
 the guitar tones bear a certain resemblance to lsfs hide me from next february
 guitarist charlie davis iii is fond of playing snaking countermelodies and
 aggressive leads with his guitar covered in trebly distortion his leads on
 the opener high seas are especially brash full of huge note bends and they
 cut through with slashing chords
 the bands own production gives the album a rather dry direct feeling which
 works well for the most part it especially suits the mathy guitar parts and
 remarkably restrained singing on sitting still talking about jets a song
 that could easily drown if treated to too much reverb unfortunately the songs
 linear structure leaves it a bit unsatisfying as though there should have been
 another verse at the end
 the euphio question provides a nice contrast to the other songs with its
 relatively simple arrangement slow pace and ebow guitar lines bordering on
 pretty the vocal melody isnt quite as strong though and josh hights melodic
 bass part actually ends up stealing the show for most of the song never hear
 your words is even sparser dispensing entirely with the muscular rhythmic
 backing that drives the rest of the album entirely at first before building to
 a thunderous bridge menard coats the whole song in a rich melody that proves
 one of his most compelling
 another great champion sought thought and died follows a similar formula
 beginning with quietly creeping verses over a steady kick drum and droning bass
 the intensity gradually builds and recedes as menard alternates between melodic
 singing and agitated shouting finally the song bursts into processed hardcore
 shouting and stuttering guttural guitar riffs at the 4xbdminute mark this
 raging climax ultimately gives out though leaving the song to end with a brief
 passage of quiet cleantoned guitar and subtle bass strumming
 the album closes with the illustrious daniel boone pioneer of social ingenuity
 which changes things up by crashing in noisily before calming for the verses
 davis ebow finds its way back into the mix as well arcing about behind menard
 in the first few verses before making its final exit the song unfortunately
 cant quite support itself for its full 6xbd minutes occasionally falling into
 listless passages that arent convincing enough melodically or rhythmically
 its a fairly minor disappointment though coming at the end of an album with
 quite a few highlights
they raging quiet army is a strong debut when taken as a whole though the
 band definitely has a little cleaning up to do here and there the detachment kit
 have proven that they have the range it takes to someday make a truly great record
 and perhaps with another guiding hand such as an outside producer they should be
 able to do it soon for now though lets just say theyve done their city proud
 and leave it at thatevery time a great pop band bombs the fans and critics scratch their heads and
 wonder why the beatles became the biggest rock group in history but their
 offspring from big star to xtc to the dbs barely touched the charts how
 can you not win with music so upbeat accessible and inventive those hooks
 those great guitar licks
 
 but its important to remember that no band no matter how good has a birthright
 to stardom guitarheavy pop music hasnt gotten anybody laid since the sixties
 you can dance to it but you sure as hell cant neck to it the musicians arent
 even sexy look at the beatles and then pull out a photo of big star and try to
 pick the cute one the bands hoped to conquer the school proms and teeny
 boppers but big stars alex chilton later speculated on their true fanbase i
 think it just sorta strikes a resonant chord with people who are in the same boat
 as we were you know confused twentyyearold college students with a guitar
 in their hands would i rather hear these bands at the super bowl halftime show
 sure but were stuck with aerosmith so it goes
 
 the dbs an earlytomid80s southern jangle pop band from winstonsalem via new
 york city got more bad breaks than most poor record sales kept them from
 building an audience the albums on this twoforone reissue cd stands for
 decibels and repercussion werent even released in the states until
 after the band broke up db peter holsapple has said that back when he worked at
 a record store he steered customers to xtc and squeeze albums because his own
 bands imports cost too much proving once again that there is no karma in rock
 
 yet the band were always critical favorites and played a major part in spawning
 the janglepop sound later perfected by rem and mitch easters lets active
 atop their twoguitar lineup the dbs experiment with keyboards and effects
 firing rounds of world class hooks at fans feet and daring them not to pogo
 and all this while retaining such a distinct sound unlike many guitarpop bands
 of the time the dbs preferred a live unpolished sound to glossy 80s production
 
 while lead singers and songwriters holsapple and chris stamey didnt exactly have
 the strongest voices they knew how to wrap their vocals around a catchy line and
 more importantly how to sing about a girl like they meant it on stands for
 decibels holsapple writes the more straightahead tunes the flawless big
 brown eyes or the 50sangst number the fight stamey meanwhile contributes
 the quirkyalmostspastic numbers like cycles per second and scores the albums
 most heartfelt moment on im in love his voice almost breaks as he belts out
 i dont understand
 
 on the cleanersounding more mature repercussion
 holsapples songs are more dire but they always manage to maintain catchiness
 the albums single amplifier famously discusses suicide with clever lyrics
 over an unwaveringly bouncy pop backing as holsapple turned serious stamey
 delivered ridiculously catchy songs like ask for jill where he reenacts being
 turned down via telephone repercussion suggests a developing band and a
 terrific songwriting partnership but soon after mtv rejected the video for
 amplifier because of the suicide theme stamey quit the band and more bad luck
 kept their next albums from doing much better than the first
 
 in interviews and the liner notes to this disc the dbs sound resigned to their
 nearmiss with success and imagine if they had started out today kay guys
 our research says the kids want christian rock bands that dont actually talk
 about god how long can you grow your hair but as i set this disc next to my
 other cult band reissues i think about what alex chilton once said about his
 career somewhere along the line i figured out that if you only press up one
 hundred copies of a record then eventually it will find its way to the one
 hundred people in the world who want it the most watching the dbs fans from
 the early college djs who managed to find these albums to the niche labels who
 reissue them today its reassuring to find that chilton was rightyouve got your daddys eyes and your daddy was an alcoholic ive got
 something in my throat i need to be alone when i suffer so wipe the makeup
 from your face tie your hair and gently fall from grace give me a call when
 youre so sensitive its a long way to fall you fell from my view son youve
 got a way to fall let me stay while they all fall to the ground theres an
 outlaw on the highway and shes falling and shes falling
 
 if it sounds like ive stumbled onto someones livejournal account its because
 james walshs lyrics read like a diary and believe me dear reader when i tell
 you that each of the sentences above is from one of his songs of the eleven
 tracks on love is here starsailors debut album more than half mention
 the world fall in some tense strange too because in interviews walsh has
 mentioned that the album title was chosen for its positivity in the light of the
 cynicism they feel in the world around them yet theres no doubt that
 starsailors qmag accolades and their trip up the charts has been
 influenced by coldplay travis and those other melancholy radiorock bands from
 their native england
 
 walshs voice for his part makes and breaks the band his wavering baritone
 doesnt sound much like a twentyyearold though it does bear an uncanny
 similarity at times to both lives ed kowalcyzk and david gray but his
 bandmates play foil to his ambition with the simplicity of their arrangements
 james stelfoxs bass and ben byrnes drums create a vaguely soulful backbeat
 and barry westheads keyboards add ornamentation swelling during the inevitably
 overblown climax of each song producer steve osbourne should probably get
 credit as the fifth bandmember his work with the happy mondays to curve to paul
 oakenfold has given him the experience to craft a truly special sound here lush
 and yet conveying an acoustic atmosphere
 
 if only walsh co knew such subtlety the energy and emotion in these ballads
 comes across a hell of a lot more sincere than the matchbox twenties of the world
 but starsailor err so far on the opposite end that youre beaten about the ears
 on the aforereferenced alcoholic walsh whines dont you know youve got your
 daddys eyes your daddy was an alcoholic but your mother kept it all inside and
 she threw it all away the sharp piano chords mix with his voice like a longlost
 journey tearjerker and you know you can expect the entrance of the drums just
 as the second verse begins and walshs delivery sounding so deliberate and
 forced doesnt do the track any favors
 
 tie up my hands the opener plods forward with soft bass and softer bass drum
 and its a nice enough lure but walsh adopts this nurseryrhyme vocal hook
 take the disaffected life men who ran the company ran your life you could have
 been his wife he wants to be the tragic hero so bad and the chorus blazes with
 dramatic guitarwork while he reels off i wanna hold you but my hands are tied i
 wanna stay here but ive been denied he is pretty hunky i have to admit but
 bonos ego stole the same earnest rockstar pose long ago and forever doomed his
 followers to imitation plus you really cant forgive lyrics like she just
 wept like i could not ignore how can i act when my hearts on the floor if
 walsh didnt steal the scene so much you might notice the other musicians
 contributions more often the constant acoustic strum and piano progressions on
 poor misguided fool near tindersticks territory and in the middle of talk her
 down the guys bust into this beautiful churning wreck of a breakdown keyboards
 swirling and cymbals crashing
love is here isnt bad and its prospect for radio play is far more
 appealing than say train the four just dont have the depth of their admitted
 influences neil young van morrison and tim buckley the band is named after one
 of his albums though they have much room for growth most of the songs sound
 too similar a brooding verse matched by a bombastic chorus and walshs fall
 imagery doesnt seem so much conceptual as it does repetitive occasionally as
 on the closer coming down walsh hushes his voice into intimacy as he asks
 were you always coming down but usually its the most blatant of dashboard
 confessionals daddy ive got nothing left my life is good my loves a mess
 
 people get onto indie rock for being inaccessible but ill take pavements
 latent causes sterile gauzes and the bedside morale any day over starsailors
 theres a hole inside my boat and i need to stay afloat for the summer
 maybe starsailor will hit it big here in the postseptember11th us as they
 did in the uk theyve got that whiny doleful sensitivity that appeals to the
 masses but i dont get the cathartic release theyre aiming for instead i
 just feel like fallingfuture pilot aka is sushil k dade the former bassist for the early 90s
 alternative rock band the soup dragons so it isnt surprising in the least
 that he would want to distance himself from his past remarkably hes done a
 pretty good job of it with this project 1999s a galaxy of sound
 featured an inspired crew of collaborators including the pastels the red
 krayola bill wells and kim fowley among others but the new record tiny
 waves mighty sea is less of an intercontinental flight than future pilots
 maiden voyage
tiny waves shares its predecessors collaborateordie inclination but
 this time dade invites musicians closer to his scottish home this means i miss
 a second chance to hear him mixing it up with suicides alan vega and andy
 weatherall of two lone swordsmen and i really miss not hearing another dade
 composition featuring exfall girl brix smith in these artists stead dade
 has corralled members of belle and sebastian the pastels again superstar
 the delgados teenage fanclub and erm james for three days dade frolicked
 around with the scottish indie elite resulting in a soothing pastoral album that
 more than whiffs of positive love vibes and patchouli george harrison would have
 loved it
 
 like a galaxy of sound tiny waves mighty sea doesnt conceal
 dades indian heritage but unlike members of the angloasian underground dade
 doesnt drop in clanging signifiers such as sputtering tabla runs sitar jams
 or acrobatic vocal melismatics in fact belle and sebastians stuart murdoch
 sings the albums most overtly indian song om namah shivaya dade thereby
 neatly sidesteps stereotype and at the same time fully expresses the nationless
 raceless universality of the mantra that literally means i bow to shiva shiva
 being the supreme reality of your inner self perhaps some purists will criticize
 dade for relocating indian devotional music in such an unorthodox setting but to
 me dades musical accompaniment to this tenminute swelling and receding acoustic
 waltz reinforces his insistence of the universality of the chant
tiny waves mighty sea doesnt open with such grand intentions maid of
 the loch is a dreamy slightly familiar instrumental that introduces the tranquil
 musical themes dade expands upon over the albums thirteen tracks amidst
 glockenspiel chimes and background vocals from the pastels katrina mitchell
 isobel campbell lends her indiebaby whisper to the almost nursery rhymelike
 traditional hymn ananda is the ocean superstars joe mcalinden and jim

 96yearold julia smith met dade while he was working for alzheimers scotland
 written by nineteenthcentury balladeer stephen foster beautiful dreamer is
 less known than fosters most famous songs jeanie with the light brown hair
 swanee river and camptown races smiths performance is of course fragile
 but as she sings you can hear the rush of a youthful past fondly remembered
 its as moving a performance as voices of old people the dialogcollage simon
 and garfunkel included on bookends
 
 for the devotional shree ram jai ram dade wraps the chanted vocals of his wife
 vinita in glockenspiel tinkles ground bass notes and ralph macdonalds jittering
 saxophone stephen pastel contributes a tremolo guitar and electronic treatments
 to the lullaby opel waters norman blake steps up to the vocal mike for beat
 of a drum which is predictably the most poppy and upbeat track here lyrically
 beat of a drum is nothing spectacular a message song about the healing
 properties of music dade neednt resort to the hamfisted language of pop
 psychology to make his point the other tracks on this album far more powerfully
 convey dades message than the lyrics blake gamely and obligingly sings
 
 after stuart murdochs meditative highlight tiny waves mighty sea returns
 to earth with macdonalds tenor sax crying a coltrane blues amid multiple reverbed
 guitars and bill wells wurlitizer once the feedback screeches have faded the
 album closes in appropriate blissfulness with vinita dades unaccompanied
 prayer for ananda
 
 just as a galaxy of sound showcased dades experimental side tiny waves
 mighty sea bountifully displays dades tenderness and spirituality a fusion
 of these two sides of dades artistry would make for an album greater than the
 sum of its parts and far hipper than the cred of dades collaborators for now
 tiny waves mighty sea will tide me over well enoughi have a hunch that sarah dougher would intimidate me not in a starstuck sort
 of way like when you find yourself catching a peripheral glance of an icon at
 the center seat of an entourage table in the sort of place that probably shouldnt
 have even admitted you and while you mull over possible comments or questions
 you totter on your poor choice of last seasons footwear and spill your beer all
 over the tables most belligerent member
 
 not that this has happened to me
 
 the intimidation factor on sarah dougher arises out of a sense that from what
 ive read shes a woman who has her shit together shes a professor of writing
 and classical mythology among other things the author of books on racism and
 railroad building an exmember of bands like the lookers the crabs and
 cadallaca and a solo artist with as of right now a third solo album under her
 belt her latest the bluff caused me to throw open my car doors sit on
 the hood and enjoy the freezing cold of the blue ridge parkway soundtracked by
 title song on repeat
 
 to describe this as an album consisting primarily of subtle pretty songs about
 relationships though technically it is risks pigeonholing it as another
 candidate in an increasingly forgettable list of female singersongwriters a
 conspicuous thread of 60s psychedelic rock runs through the uptempo tracks on
 the first part of the album the best of these must believe features doughers
 swirling organ work and a nuggetsera minor key guitar line the lyrics
 are simple enough but when dougher sings when you hold me in your arms i must
 believe its true the manifest sense of desperation helped by corin tuckers
 banshee backing vocals elevates the overall sense to something more than
 retropop likewise keep me features a borderline surfrock guitar line and
 deceivingly straightforward lyrics in the verses while walking the fine line
 between rage and regret in the choruses you ask me in and then treat me like an
 uninvited whore dont throw it away nothing beautiful stays
 
 the second half of the album flirts with a wider variety of influences and
 within these dougher has some really spectacular moments the spare drum machine
 bossa nova of system works resolves itself into a wailing crunchy chorus its
 a juxtaposition that works and one of the most unusual songs on the album others
 are less successful the politely folky my kingdom is pretty but predictable
 and youll swear youve heard the spare major key blues on fall down before
 the meditative organ ballad the choice has a nice resonance to it but feels
 druggy and plodding after the albums first half say what you like about
 complaints concerning the track sequence but it seems to me the excellent
 affecting cover of allen toussaints 1962 piano blues its raining would have
 been a better candidate for album closer
 
 this is an easy album to digest cleaner more cautious and less raw than
 doughers previous the walls ablaze the edge primarily exists in the
 contrast between doughers earthy plaintive vocal quality and the tidy lines in
 the songs greater pains have been taken to blur the rawness around the edges
 ive always suspected sarah dougher is the kind of performer whos constantly
 engaged in an internal dialogue with her own impulses as if her more explosive
 inclinations are tempered by a kind of cautious restraint both instrumentally
 and vocally she never surrenders herself wholly to a particular persona neither
 spunky petulant rocker nor melancholic storyteller and some of the best moments
 occur when these internal arguments reveal themselves within the body of songs
 like midway through the elegant enigmatic title track when hanging over a
 precipice of building guitars dougher suddenly pulls back and resolves into
 sweet and cautious it works
 
 the bluff
 
 yeah i get itin his later years american composer morton feldman wrote long compositions
 really really long compositions piano and string quartet and for
 bunita marcus each fill an eighty minute cd for christian wolff
 runs around three hours for philip guston clocks in at over four each
 piece is monolithic with no interruptions and no movements or other divisions
 the mother of them all however is his untilnow unrecorded string quartet
 ii hat huts hatnowart imprint just released the first recording performed
 by members of the ives ensemble for a duration of almost five hours first
 performed by the kronos quartet the piece runs anywhere between four and
 allegedly six hours with few rests and no interruptions kronos performed it
 live several times and never recorded it they cancelled their scheduled final
 performance for health reasons david harrington violinist and kronos artistic
 director said in an interview for the nea the second quartet is
 physically so demanding i think marathon runners must go through the same
 thing we do when we play the second quartet you go in and out of feeling
 your body is going to break even right now when im thinking of the second
 quartet i have a shooting pain in my back
 feldman fans have been waiting for a recording of string quartet ii since
 feldman wrote it eighteen years ago even if the ives ensemble blew it this
 record would be a milestone as it happens this is a terrific performance of a
 fascinating work that rewards all the time you can give it
 anyone who hasnt heard a feldman piece may wonder how the time passes the short
 answer is that it doesnt one of feldmans agendas was to turn time into space
 to make time feel not like a line but like a landscape that the listener has
 dropped into the pieces hardly begin and dont seem to end he uses only a few
 themes but as he repeats a phrase or motif he alters it by changing the time
 signature or the dynamics in subtle but discernable ways rather than repetitive
 the simplest elements become engrossing with that construction the size of the
 works gives them mass during for philip guston a phrase may slowly repeat
 until its heavy and unmovable like a boulder settling on the floor of the ocean
 this superficially sounds like a deep listening exercise but unlike ambient
 music theres no slack feldmans excruciating detail and strict control make
 the works mentally engaging refusing to allow a passive audience it doesnt
 become the background it becomes the air youre breathing
 though its his longest string quartet ii is one of feldmans most dynamic
 and aggressive works the strings jump between themes play occasional flurries of
 notes and produce a more grinding and aggressive sound than on say the serene
 and austere piano and string quartet in the first 2xbd hours the music
 ranges from barely audible to enraged a set of themes is reworked and revisited
 theyre so short that they seem more like gestures until youve heard them so
 many times that they become melodies progress is only experienced measure by
 measure before the piece changes direction again by the third disc it calms down
 sections last longer and sound more subdued and some of them are outright pretty
 feldman even throws in a brief pizzicato cello part thats almost funky the last
 disc doesnt offer a sharp ending theres a slow trailing off that again suggests
 its not done were just leaving it behind
 having never heard the piece in concert i cant compare this debut recording to
 any other performance the ives ensembles playing is just short of academic but
 appropriate for this piece feldman specifies many tonal colors that the musicians
 go to pains to reproduce accurately and engagingly and they dont show the fatigue
 you might expect at the end theyve performed this in concert a few times and
 may be in shape but im also not sure how or in how many pieces they recorded
 it
 hatnowart published string quartet ii in an edition of only 3000 copies
 which is like locking people out of museums but which might meet demand thats
 unfortunate feldman is essential listening new listeners might start with
 shorter works like kronos piano and string quartet or the new albion
 edition of rothko chapel but everyone should have a chance to confront
 this thing at least oncein terms of population canada 31 million has new york 8 million beat by a
 long shot but in an ode to the capitalist spirit of efficiency new yorkers have
 accomplished a stunning feat of peoplepacking while canadians bogart a whopping
 38 million square miles of the continent new yorkers shoehorn themselves into a
 mere 320 thats 25000 new yorkers per square mile versus a lonely 8 per square
 mile in the great white north for new yorkers this means doublingup living in
 closets and moving to hoboken for canadians it means just the opposite
 solitude and a plethora of moose one of which stars on haydens album cover
 
 canadian hayden dessers sounds of solitude have captured the ears of sadcore
 indiefolk fans ever since his debut lp everything i long for was
 released in 1996 the album recorded on a fourtrack at his parents house was
 notable for its contrast of wistful tenderness and snarling anger and of course
 haydens striking baritone on its followup the closer i get hayden had
 less to growl about but just as much to long for finding its high points with
 two doors and between us to hold
 
 now after a threeyear hiatus hayden has returned with his third lp skyscraper
 national park the album casts hayden as older wiser and more reflective
 hayden is still a man steeped in his own sensitivity but hes changed a bit with
 age youthful idealistic romance has grown into love hopefulness into doubt
 and anger into distance accompanying his maturity is a newfound and uncanny
 sense of restraint that both binds the disc and renders his passion haunting and
 compelling not once does hayden burst into a growl instead the album is marked
 by frequent reliance on a simple falsetto
 
 haydens progression is apparent from the opening chords of street car faint
 and filtered with audible squeaks and shimmers of haydens fingers on the
 fretboard of his 12string a piano joins only on downbeats and both play an
 ideal forum for haydens forlorn lyrics parked underground the night you left
 it took me an hour and a half to find my way back up above theres nothing up
 there without your love
 
 dynamite walls is as close hayden has come to perfecting his craft the song
 features an uptempo beat for hayden and a full band dwelling on fresh spacious
 instrumentation and a subdued melody until it releases into a magnificent
 crescendo the lyrics including the chorus miles away just up ahead it
 doesnt matter just what any of us is looking for well never find it because
 its not even there are a shockingly precise complement to the music conjuring
 images of driving through open spaces and mountain air after dynamite walls
 skyscraper national park levels into a sonic consistency of subdued
 melodies and sparse instrumentation
 
 all in one move is one of cheeriest tunes on the album so much so that it can
 properly be called a tune not surprisingly for sadman hayden at about one
 minute in length its also the shortest song on the disc so before he manages
 to lift himself out of depression he regresses into bass song featuring lyrics
 as genial and optimistic as i couldnt find shit so i grabbed my bass guitar by
 the neck and held it above me and hid by the top of the stairs and thats where
 i was found five days after i hit the ground
 
 hayden closes the album nicely with lullaby less melodyfocused than the rest
 of the album and more akin to the mood music of such slowcore stalwarts as low
 and idaho on it hayden beckons his beloved to close your eyes and think about
 what you cant live without the invitation is as appropriate to the listener as
 to his lover it is what it says a lullaby fading peacefully into sleep
 
 although its best moments dont reach quite the altitudes of his prior releases
 skyscraper national park as a whole is the most complete and coherent
 album in haydens catalog a delightful listen from track one through track eleven
 the union of his established songwriting talent with his poignant maturity and
 restraint make skyscraper national park convincing powerful and well
 worth purchasingso its been a long time since the whole madchester thing back then pretty much
 everyone had written off the charlatans as alsorans their early offerings just
 didnt match up to the mighty stone roses or happy mondays thankfully for us
 the charlatans were undaunted by their own press and by now theyve outlived
 every other band of that allbutforgotten early 90s movement and anyone
 checking out the uk charts could tell you that theyve definitely had the last
 laugh despite the tragedies and calamities that have delayed them on their way
 into the vanguard of prominent uk rock acts
 
 it seems somewhat fitting that the bands seventh album coming just over ten
 years after their debut should find them reexploring some of the dancerock
 fusion that carried their first efforts their last album 1999s us us
 only found them more squarely in tradrock territory than ever before
 bathing in ominous analog synths and searching for answers the change probably
 stemmed a great deal from the fact that it was the bands first album written in
 the wake of original keyboardist rob collins death in a car accident
wonderland takes the sound of that last album and pumps it full of the
 energy that dripped from the bands previous releases resulting in a record that
 can oddly be both fragile danceable and anthemic all at the same time lets
 put it this way if this album had been released in 1992 it would almost certainly
 have been held up as a future classic a decade later it simply sounds damn
 good
 
 perhaps the biggest difference in the bands sound on wonderland is in tim
 burgess voice he adopts a previously unknown falsetto on several of the songs
 here and though its not as strong as his usual singing voice it works
 surprisingly well in most places case in point is the first single love is
 the key a catchy rbinfluenced tune replete with female backing singers
 drummer john brookes and bassist martin blunt drive the song hard but its tony
 rogers funky organ comping and rhodes lines that really elevate it rogers has
 done remarkably well for himself trying to fill rob collins sizable shoes since
 joining the band and here he continues to assert himself as the charlatans
 guiding musical force
 
 nearly as obvious a choice for a single is i just cant get over losing you
 which creeps in slowly before kicking into another one of the bands infectious
 grooves burgess exhorts you to get down and its pretty likely that you wont
 have any problem complying guitarist mark collins weaves dozens of little
 stuttering passages through the mix vying with rogers for control of the harmonic
 and countermelodic space this is followed by the instrumental the bell and the
 butterfly a fourminute bass and drumdominated raveup that opens with a
 bombastic fuzzedout bass riff then completely recontextualizes the riff with
 programmed almost junglist beats brookes joins the programmed percussion on
 his kit as blunt briefly reprises the bassline from love is the key before
 launching off on an impressive lead tangent
 
 tracks like the bell and the butterfly are one of the reasons i love the
 charlatans as much as i do in an era when its cool for rock bands to be ashamed
 of being rock bands the charlatans arent no matter how much programming they
 incorporate or how many other elements color their sound theyre a rock band at
 heart unafraid to rock out just for the sake of it and theres plenty of subtle
 programming to be found on wonderland little artificial hihat flourishes
 color the edges of the beat in and if i fall which just might contain one of
 the best choruses the band has ever written
 
 elsewhere a man needs to be told most closely resembles us us onlys
 rootsy vibe employing none other than daniel lanois on the pedal steel its
 amazing how well the fauxcountry sound suits the band burgess falsetto feels
 more at home surrounded by the keening guitars and extra percussion provided by
 jim keltner whos played with absolutely everybody including bob dylan elvis
 costello ry cooder george harrison and john lennon wake up runs in a
 slightly similar vein breaking into a melodic ballad after a guitar intro that
 you could pretty easily mistake for a mid80s king crimson track soon afterward
 though the guitar is dripping in leslie and wah pedals burgess presides over
 the song with some uncharacteristically aggressive lyrics including the catchy
 couplet sayin something saying nothing youll be a little quieter with a
 gun in your mouth
 
 this is followed by the mellotron and pianodrenched is it in you which
 for all its gripping atmosphere is one of the few songs on the album that
 doesnt really hang onto your ear after grabbing it the closing ballad of the
 band doesnt really do much to lift things either and the album unfortunately
 ends on a somewhat lackluster note
 
 regardless of the ending though the charlatans have managed to release yet
 another immensely satisfying album the deft synthesis of all of the bands past
 incarnations speaks to the fact that their best work may indeed lie ahead of them
 if youre looking for a starting place for the charlatans id probably recommend
 tellin stories or us us only first but wonderland is a
 worthy entry from one of britains most underappreciated bandsso ive rolled up my shirt sleeves and sat my ass in front of the computer screen
 ive primed my fingers to write something cute or creative nothing has come
 sorry about dresden has me stumped their music is so uninspiring its jolted
 me into writers block lets just get this over with
 
 sorry about dresden sad is a fivepiece ensemble from north carolina that
 specializes in guitarheavy indie rock the music definitely has more mainstream
 appeal than your average hipster geeks the focus is on the songwriting a blend
 of pop melodies and growling relationship angst songs frequently end with
 choruses repeated as a mantra with vocalist matt oberst yes of the notorious
 oberst clan progressively gaining more passion
 
 when oberst wants you to feel his pain its a little too obvious usually
 delivered high and hard at the top of his range if i had to peg his voice
 id say its a cross of dave pirner and elvis costello replete with faux british
 accent ive said this numerous times before but i will repeat it here there is
 unequivocally no point to this record be proud of your home tarheel state
 matt
 
 if i were in the mood for conspiracy theories id also complain about the
 sequencing of the tracks just for kicks picture the convenience of
 indecision as a mathematical function if the album could be graphed it
 would start fairly high at around the 7 or 8 range the opening track a
 losing season and regress downwards with a slope of negative one until it
 reaches 0 with the unimaginative throwaway closer a reunion of sorts to
 put it another way its a top heavy album everything worth listening to is in
 the first four tracks it seems like a ruse to con music store listeners into
 purchasing an lp with the substance of an ep maybe they should title the disc
 the convenience of capitalizing on instore listeningkiosk impatience
 or not but honesty would be nice
 
 cutting to the chase the convenience of indecision is nondescript
 semiindie rock with little to grab a hold of sorry about the writers block
 but sorry about dresden will do that to youiconoclasts suffer its the fate of simply being yourself such is the story
 of jonathan richman jonathans the type of guy whod have serenaded the head
 cheerleader at two am in a mariachi outfit and done it straightfaced with
 complete sincerity shed have been creeped out and jonathan wouldve inevitably
 been beaten bloody by her boyfriend but once he wised up and turned his attention
 to the girls that are truly feverish for romance those geeky girls with
 harlequins tucked under their mattresses theyd swoon to his unabashedly
 heartfelt and nave yearning of course such romanticism is cloying when taken
 seriously but richman always conveys however subtly that his tongues
 incheek
 richmans not a newcomer to the music scene by any stretch of the imagination
 including the couple of albums he cut with the seminal protopunk band the modern
 lovers her mystery not of high heels and eye shadow represents his 19th
 fulllength release despite recording one of the most prescient albums in rock
 history and his prolific catalog richman is still a pretty obscure artist with
 a small following but even if youve never heard the name jonathan richman
 chances are youre more familiar with him than you think largely due to his
 cameos in theres something about mary yes that was him and his little
 segues actually manage to give a pretty good general impression of her mystery
 not of high heels and eye shadow
 the seeds of richmans current sound were all sewn in the winsome 1950s sparse
 rockabilly and doowop arrangements filled with conventional romantic truisms
 but also sharpened with an understated wit there are even some awkward ventures
 into latin forms like the bolero meringue and the samba as stiff and amusing as
 a gringo learning to salsa its all lightweight stuff but thats where its
 charm lies
her mystery is full of the mawkish sentimentality of young love nave
 sexuality and the stirrings of spring on canal street in april
 when its 60 and the snow is melting fast its still shady in the morning when
 youre laughing in your tshirt running past in tompkins square park a couple is
 meeting say what you want but i feel my heart beating because i love springtime
 in new york springtime in new york i do from springtime in new york sums up
 the wideeyed gumplike unaffectedness of the songs here the album contains
 about as many illicit thoughts as a eunuch in a harem
 later on the same track he sings on 1st avenue a couple is breakin up
 eviction too they must be shaken up but i love springtime in new york its
 lines like these that give the album its clever offkilter orientation nothing
 seems to bring this guy down i dont think theres an ounce of cortisol in his
 system even conflict is viewed as naturally as a morning shit in songs like
 couples must fight my heart knows pain my heart knows sorrow my heart knows
 wrongs that could never make right but for a better day tomorrow couples must
 argue couples must fight a five year old couldnt state it more simply
 i dont know how well richman knows his spanish but the last four songs are sung
 exclusively en espaol as eagerly as a student looking for extra credit
 he reminded me of david byrne toying with these latin rhythms the voices are
 even quite similar and there seems to be a strain of trio los panchos influence
 winding its way through the album with the intricate guitar picking that opens
 some of the tracks
 for the most part the songs are stripped to the bare
 minimum acoustic guitar bass and a minimal drum kit often played with a brush
 theres an appearance from what sounds like a bass clarinet on i took a chance
 and the title track and theres some additional percussion to spice things up on
 the latin numbers but thats it the album as a whole encompasses enough styles
 to sound almost like a cover album many of the tracks sound vaguely familiar
 with richman providing new lyrics the rhythmic progression of springtime in
 new york is just like princes the beautiful ones tonight is earth angel
 and others were agonizingly hard to place but i think mostly the familiarity is
 just the result of the deceptive simplicity of these songs
 albums this unpretentious are increasingly rare and i think thats what makes
 her mystery not of high heels and eye shadow so seductive we all used to
 view the world this way before we hit puberty got a job got dumped a few times
 and became so suspicious of others motives its nice to know we have albums
 like this to turn on instead of cnn when we want things to be just a little less
 complicatedto poorly paraphrase john cage from his book silence if you pay close
 enough attention anything can become interesting and a source of inspiration
 its only when we try to ignore something say a sound that it becomes
 annoying or boring
 
 im not sure of the universality of that statement but such is the case with
 champaign illinois laterna on its longdelayed sophomore album elm street
 all instrumental and performed exclusively on guitar arp synth and drum kit
 elm street features 12 ambient minimalist treks through inner and outer
 space if you allow them the songs will just kind of hang there like an old
 landscape painting in your grandmothers parlor that no one ever looks at but
 if youre in the right frame of mind maybe after a couple cups of coffee the
 record immerses you in a idyllic windswept world of sound its the kind of music
 that might accompany a film adaptation of ray bradburys dandelion wine
 safe and sentimental while simultaneously implying a darker harsher world
 
 the album begins with the title track which starts with a finely picked acoustic
 guitar pattern slowly fading cymbal crashes if you can even call them crashes
 and distant droning its got a pastoral quaint and jovial quality that makes
 it sound like segue music from northern exposure bminor is next introducing
 an electrified u2sounding guitar jangle to the mix that sticks around for nearly
 the entire album its echo and reverb set on maximum
 
 the next set of songs spirits thirty and departure indistinguishably
 meld into one elongated cycle undercutting the playful jovial vibe of the first
 two tracks with an increasingly eerie and spooky buildup and making greater use
 of the arp by the time the creepy scifisounding old seattle comes around
 the guitar has virtually been abandoned but then its quickly back to earth with
 wolves which as might be guessed uses some cheesy fx to mimic a certain lupine
 howl
 
 smoke with its galloping rhythm is the sound trying to get home before
 nightfall while saturns rings despite its otherworldly title sounds more
 like that nightfall slowly settling in like it does on long summer days new
 moon returns to the acoustic ambience of the leadoff track minus the drums
 while glass is the exact opposite as the closest thing to a rocker youre gonna
 get with this album the songs drums come out of hibernation and theres even a
 touch of distortion on the guitar dog days rounds out the album with a 12minute
 patiencetester that fades out with the latesummer drones of cicada and cricket
 chirps a nice touch to cap off the album but a bit long to wait for it
 
 upon first listen i mistook lanternas brand of slowpaced sonic sculpture for
 new age music and they do lean in that direction from time to time veering
 dangerously close to songs of the whale territory but after a few times
 through i saw something closer to frippeno or even instrumental felt though
 not nearly as layered as the former and not as chiming and rifforiented as the
 latter and though the band is still a long way from such minimalist masters as
 glass reich or riley they still successfully manage to do a whole lot within
 the very narrow confines theyve set for themselvesbeing a talented musician must be pretty cool while other people spend hours at
 a time hunched over their respective instruments trying desperately to come up
 with a single song thats worth a damn you can do better things with your time
 for instance you can feed a hungry child or you can build a terrarium or if
 youre so inclined you can record a terrible album with your talented musician
 friends
 
 of course talent is not without its down side one of the most common arguments
 used in the defense of shitty music is hey man these guys may not be the best
 musicians in the world but they work totally hard ive known them for years
 and ive never known more hardworking dedicated people fuck you for judging
 them they once slept on my couch i know the bassists sister in other words
 they have no talent but they try really hard but when a slew of crazily
 talented musicians come together and turn out a sloppy and tossedoff mess
 things are a little harder to justify
 
 the drag city supersession is made up of core musicians bill callahan smog
 rian murphy neil michael hagerty and edith frost all are talented performers
 and songwriters all have made significant contributions to the world of
 independent music and all have done so in their own distinctively unique ways
 yet with tramps traitors and little devils the focus that has enabled
 these musicians to create such convincing work is entirely absent and as they
 struggle through weakasfuck sabbath covers and barely rehearsed originals it
 leaves this record sounding less like a supersession than a high school talent
 show
 
 sloppiness is okay when its a byproduct of uncontainable energy but on
 tramps traitors and little devils with its awkward fumbling guitar
 parts and poorly arranged strings one cant help but feel that this was a
 project thrown together quickly by people who really didnt give a fuck about
 it theres no energy theres no fun theres no reason for them to subject
 people to this
 
 within the first few seconds of the bill callahan original zero degrees that
 opens the record its clear that tramps traitors and little devils isnt
 going to be an easy ride the song itself is not nearly up to par with most of
 callahans material relying mostly upon a vaguely dissonant and tremendously
 uninteresting bass riff but as the song develops it becomes clear why callahan
 wouldnt have wanted one of his better songs to appear on this record its hard
 to imagine somebody saying why dont i use one of my best songs for this new
 throwntogether supersession so that neil michael hagerty can skullfuck it with
 an outoftune slide guitar theres nothing wrong with being a little out of
 tune when the music calls for it but the combination of sloppy tuneless guitar
 and pointless unmelodic bass makes zero degrees nothing short of painful
 listening if the musicians involved in this record actually listened back to
 this kind of thing and said man i cant wait for my name to be attached
 to this they should at the very least retire and at the very most be forcefed
 their own ears
 
 perhaps im being a little too hard on these people their collective musical
 talents have given me hours upon hours of enjoyment and musical memories that
 will last me for the rest of my life but all that just doesnt change the fact
 that tramps traitors and little devils blows at its best like on edith
 frosts leaving the army its sufficiently unobtrusive with unnecessary guitar
 plunking only minimally fucking up an otherwise passable song hey on old man
 when frost is basically left to her own for a little while its downright pretty
 but as a supersession with no one musicians vision guiding the way drag
 citys impressive roster is reduced to a tuneless jam band whose members dont
 even sound like theyre having a good time drag city indeedthere was a time hundreds of years ago where in many parts of the world there
 was no such thing as a musician thats not to say there was no music of course
 among small tribes of people in africa or the early americas there was no such
 thing as a musician because there was no such thing as a nonmusician music was
 a daily part of everyones life and without modern conveniences like turntables
 and cd players that music had to be made anew every day now when it came time
 to doing this were there those that stepped up stood out took the lead
 probably but its also a pretty safe bet that there was no such thing as an
 audience the making of music was for everybody as important a part of their
 lives as the food they ate or the air they breathed
 
 today music has become very sectionalized theres a discernable line between
 musicians and nonmusicians between those who know and those who do not but
 there are those who still scoff at such segregation those who recognize that
 music is in the hearts of us all it merely needs to be conjured up for every
 buzzkill who believes music to be a solely academic exercise there are those who
 believe otherwise those who recognize that when it comes to making music theres
 something more important than training discipline or hard work passion there
 are to this day people who believe as did the far wiser souls who graced these
 grounds before us that music is a crucial healing force that all can and must
 play a part in for these people there is the noneck blues band an ironically
 named new york based octet making music rooted in the tradition of people for whom
 music was not some mere frivolity but a way of life
 
 the music on sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
 has a very primal feel about it these are songs built out of the chants moans
 and screams of its makers every bit as much as pianos guitars basses harmonicas
 flutes horns and drums the songs here often start slow with one two or three
 members of the group picking up a simple musical idea and running with it very
 patiently theyll elaborate on their chosen theme while the rest of the octet
 flounders about it searching for different ways to interact waiting for the
 right point of entry this is a fascinating process one which allows the listener
 to observe while these songs are repeatedly built taken apart and put back
 together
 
 assignment subud for example one of the few tracks on the album given a name
 begins with a prolonged period of improvised noise percussion is played
 haphazardly bereft of any rhythm woodwinds and strings enter and exit each
 taking their own paths and unconcerned with the other instruments guitars are
 strummed at random a spastic saxophone interjects wildly a few minutes in a
 distant female voice appears in the mix as the percussion tightens slightly like
 buzzards coming together from disparate parts of the sky starting to circle
 preparing to swoop down upon a carcass a bass is bowed a male voice joins in
 the two singers interact not concerning themselves with words using their voices
 instead as instruments by the sixminute mark the pieces begin to come together
 the guitar parts begin to resemble a melody the vocals take a nonstatic pattern
 and the percussion section tightens now keeping a very discernable very driven
 beat around which the other instruments sculpt their improvisations from here
 on in the song propels itself building towards a dramatic climax where the
 saxophone returns squealing madly as the male vocalist cries out in passion he
 speaks no words and yet the listener understands
 
 other songs like the natural bridge the albums opener move along at a more
 peaceful pace lingering on a beat and flirting with the idea of structure like
 a hybrid between an native american chant and the art ensemble of chicagos most
 outthere moments elsewhere on the albums untitled closer the group nearly
 finds song structure employing beefheartian tendencies both in the instrumentation
 and the vocals to their style actual lyrics and a surprisingly funky bass part
 to the groups lazy groove it almost seems strange after the freedom that
 precedes it but ultimately it makes sense noneck is a band constantly
 experimenting and constantly playing in the most innocent childlike
 sense of the word it only makes sense then that eventually theyd stumble
 upon something that resembles a traditional song and by closing the album on
 this note noneck and veteran producer jerry jester tom waits the lovin
 spoonful quiet those jaded naysayers out there who will attempt to dismiss the
 inspired freespirited nature of the music on sticks and stones as
 amateurish wankery
 
 still nonecks primal brand of improvisation might be a hard sell for some a
 friend of mine scoffed upon first hearing this album i dunno he said its
 okay but it sounds a lot like a bunch of us just jamming in the basement maybe
 im just not giving us enough credit but i dont really get it but thats just
 it he wasnt giving us enough credit when i play music with my friends we
 dont do it with any intentions of fame money or recognition we do it because
 its fun we do it because we love to do it theres a certain quality something
 magical to these sorts of haphazard musical excursions where whats missing in
 proper structure and form is more than made up for in passion and energy and its
 this same quality that makes the noneck blues band so damned amazing
 
 the more i think about it the less i consider the noneck blues bands name to be
 ironic in a sense the music on sticks and stones has more to do with the
 blues than the surface lets on maybe not in structure but in the way it
 transforms raw emotion into musical gold by shunning the traditional rules of
 their form throwing away all expectations ignoring all of arts potential to
 create pressure and just playing the noneck blues band has given us an album
 thats every bit as unique as it is moving indeed its the very freedom from
 typical music rules the very casual atmosphere in which this music was clearly
 created that makes it work this music was not made to sell records or to make
 the musicians household names in fact most of the band prefers to remain
 anonymous no this music was made for the only reason music should ever be
 made because it had to beas the secretly canadian story goes marmoset member jorma whittaker is the son of
 whitey whittaker the official tour bus driver for the nonsecretly canadian
 band rush for about twenty years legend has it that geddy lee played the rough
 mix of their album signals for jorma before it was released maybe
 thankfully the aynnoying individualist fetish of new world man and the analog
 kid doesnt seem to have rubbed off at all like geddy lee though jorma
 whittaker does happen to be the bassist and lead singer of his band but dont
 expect a castrated screech weve been spared such torture
 
 marmoset seems to have blissfully missed the 80s actually to be influenced by
 every other decade take golden cloak one of the bands catchier songs it
 sounds similar to the velvet undergrounds ocean an outtake from loaded
 the organ swirls like vintage cale while whittaker sings in pure reed preglam
 fashion as if filled with wonderment at the things hes discovering in his own
 song he describes the features of the cloak which makes you high and then
 he pulls the indierawk kissoff theyre features you see that hes so
 fucking sick of the song builds up all this psychrock mystique just to end
 almost indifferently half a minute later
record in red cycles through a grabbag of styles the opener eyes are
 looking is pure beat happening pop with its fey da da da malefemale harmonies
 and jangly lofi guitar then two tracks later winter rips into wild guitar
 theatrics thatll have you asking the who the driving drums and tight rhythm
 track on the city recalls the doors or the zombies dont cry for me and its
 echoing overdubbed vox might catch you doing the swim arms waving past your head
 like its the 60s all over again and just when you expect the entire album to be
 a pastiche of trendy genres december 4th drops the drums and the pretense for
 an acoustic number thats equal parts elliott smith and kurt cobain
 
 in this case it isnt an insult that you can easily come up with comparisons for
 the band if anything marmoset make a virtue out of neurotic decadehopping
 their erratic talent might seem a bit unfocused at times since songlength
 averages about two minutes but whittaker ties it all together with his charm
 his selfobsessed and sexxee vocal swoons turn each track into an anthem even on
 little vignettes like artmaker when he adopts a mockgermanic accent repeating
 the phrase artmaker strangulator into absurdity the album gives off a
 slightly dark druggy vibe especially when the handclaps and piano jabs of
 summertime is easy sink under the morbid endless repetition of whittakers
 chorus but rather than drown in affectations overall record in reds
 coy fascination with itself reminds me of why pop music is so much funotto von schirach is by some margin the most excitable boy on the schematic
 roster while richard devine abandoned the notion of dsp fuckery as an end in
 itself with the brooding aleamapper lp and scott herren has put his
 tradidm persona delarosa and asora on ice in favor of hiphop stylings of
 prefuse 73 von schirach continues his assault on stasis unabated with his second
 album the frenetic escalo frio
 
 my first pass through escalo frio was most unpleasant roughly half of the
 21 tracks here seem to me nothing more than reaktor demonstration pieces
 overflowing with an incredible array of sounds that call attention to themselves
 without ever working together to say anything interesting or even coherent
 tracks like sasquash coconut and fog are almost unbearable to sit through
 consisting of an endless stream of selfconsciously weird sounds that never
 coalesce never swing and can provoke no reaction beyond a steadily increasing
 annoyance quite honestly i cannot understand the appeal of this postautechre
 spastic colonoscopy it seems meaningless and terminally boring
 
 the only way i can make sense of the worst tracks on escalo frio is to place
 them into some kind cartoon music framework carl stalling was of course the
 genius that wrote music for warner brothers loony toons hes frequently
 namechecked by john zorn schirachs rapid changes and unfamiliar textures
 could possibly serve as the soundtrack to a parallel world built from alternate
 physics much like the one alluded to by stallings genresurfing and zany
 deployment of effects still try as i might to imagine how this music might work
 for somebody else i still dont believe it could ever work for me
 
 but these are the worst tracks im talking about the cluttered aimless displays
 of programming technique that mar more than half this disc fortunately a few
 tracks manage to make a better impression after a while of particular interest
 is schirachs dabbling in cutup hiphop reminiscent of prefuse 73 without
 seeming like a ripoff the criminally brief mr egyptian hologram which
 features some production assistance from matmos for example is a killer track
 containing an mc sample twisted into rhythmic knots nostalgic toy synths and a
 forceful bass punch coming from a similar place but without the vocals is
 fabric which is home to one of the records few headnodding rhythms and a
 production environment that allows the cutting electro rhythm room to breath
 still in the end these brief glimpses into schirachs potential as an auteur
 of 23rdcentury jeep music only make the rest of the album that much more
 difficult to bearjapanese pianist satoko fujii came about this the hard way that is she started
 playing the way youre supposed to learning etudes playing scales practicing
 all the correct fingerings being as precise as humanly possible its enough
 to drive you mad and i suppose that explains why so many concert pianists have
 hair like dudley moore and talk like well dudley moore fujii started down
 this path only to hit a brick wall about 20 years into the game so she gave
 it up for communal stompnyell sessions and cathartic group improv the end
 
 nope after a year of gathering her wits she decided jazz was where it was at
 and returned to her studied piano with a different aim she went back to taking
 lessons but this time with renowned japanese jazz pianist fumio itabashi of
 course her parents didnt approve of the new direction so fujii struck out on
 her own she eventually left for america to study at berklee college of music
 graduating in 1987 she went back to japan and made a humble rep by playing in
 jazz clubs and on television and commercial soundtracks the end
 
 not quite a few years later fujii was accepted to the new england conservatory
 of music from which she received a graduate degree in jazz performance in 1996
 there she had the opportunity to learn from greats like paul bley cecil mcbee
 and george russell her first album even featured bley and many had a difficult
 time recognizing who was playing at what point such was her stylistic advancement
 today having worked with new jazz luminaries like mark dresser jim black mark
 feldman and big bands from both new york and japan fujii is recognized as one
 of the greatest japanese jazz musicians alive and she is living happily ever
 after the end
 
 but this is not the end the deal is despite the ridiculous amount of jazz
 preparation and education fujii seems to have had her latest release vulcan
 barely sounds like jazz at all whats the story youd think that when your
 biggest reference points are supposed to be folks like bley and myra melford that
 your album wouldnt initially remind you of avantproggers like the soft machine
 or the muffins cuneiform records check em were talking extrahard drumming
 and improv that often is so off the beaten path i keep waiting for the quartet
 fujii trumpeter natsuki tamura bassist takeharu hayakawa and drummergod
 tatsuya yoshida to implode rather than work through the storms and come out
 standing as they do like clockwork every time and this is most certainly not
 an end but yet another incredible beginning from fujii
vulcan begins with the epic the sun in a moonlight night and yoshidas
 guttural shaman vocals accompanied by tamuras electricunderwater horn and
 some elastic bass fingerprints scattered here and there soon fujii joins the
 miniruckus by pretending to be cecil taylor for a time though always in the
 background so yes this is what they call free jazz or in some quarters
 noodling but then a funny thing happens yoshida drops a beat and fujii
 drops a riff and it becomes what they call superrock and it remains this
 for a whole two minutes or so before changing into a number from bizets
 carmen if it was a bass solo then yoshida crashes through the wall
 where most jazz drummers would hint at pulse or play around time or some
 such nonjam strategy soon its fujii taking the solo over the massive beats
 and bass bombs and then its tamura fujiis husband soloing and wait did
 that solo section last about ten minutes without me even once looking at my
 watch yes yes it did at the end they come back to the head and this is
 why its easy to tell people 15minute tunes arent necessarily bad
 
 incident begins like a lopsided jackson pollock painting all scribble haze
 impressions and stopstart horn utterances with bass and erratic drumming then
 the song proper starts though the head is arguably even less stable than the
 exposition with the beat changing as often as the notes in the melody its
 sometimes difficult to tell where the soloing starts and the melody begins
 but that doesnt keep the tune from jamming if only in the abstractdyslexia
 jam sense
 
 another punchy bass solo begins ninepin and just like before it seems to
 only obscure the true intentions of this tune soon the solo falls onto a
 pedal note and yoshida ushers in his ominous toms and cymbals fujii enters
 with a vaguely eastern european head doubled by tamura this is something like
 that made famous by the nyc cliquemongers john zorn with masada and chris
 speed solo and with pachora but a sight more rock where theirs was stark
 swinging and even harmelodic here after a lengthy group exposition fujii
 solos over a relatively restrained though increasingly kinetic as it progresses
 backdrop and it can still be said that yoshida is the worlds most hyperactive
 drummer in fact soon his cymbal rolls and snare blasts dominate the section
 so much so that the tune morphs into a drum solo without launching into a
 treatise on the greatness of yoshida i will say that even after a decade of
 incredible ruins releases his playing here is surprisingly fresh both in its
 singleminded forcefulness and by the way he effortlessly shifts back into the
 main head of the tune
 
 footstep and neko no yume are both quieter entries on a release that seems
 to specialize in that which pounds and sprawls the former features dark
 atmospheric playing from fujii over light cymbal work and bowed bass howls in
 the distance and it probably wouldnt sound out of place in a tense ghost story
 soundtrack the latter is more straightforward with tamura and hayakawa playing
 the real latenight smoky jazz dope chet baker gets so much credit for when it
 was probably miles davis all along in any case the tune reminds me of nobody
 so much as dave douglas though tamura doesnt quite possess his technical
 facility particularly in its juxtaposition of classic cool with modern squawk
 
 the rest of vulcan is devoted to much more aggressive aesthetics lh
 fast is ruinsstyle jumpcut avantrock untitled fools you into thinking it
 will be an introspective piano ballad but is in fact an extroverted
 iberianflavored romp and the last tune junction spells out to anyone who
 wasnt paying attention that this album is about fast and loud jams of course
 an hour of that can become taking to the ears and it helps that these guys bring
 it all back home fairly quickly in the tunes more often than not
 
 this quartet has been playing live together since 1998 and itll be interesting
 to see if they continue to release stuff together there are very few working
 jazz groups that demand the attention of the rock audience at the moment this
 is certainly no slight on todays jazz artists but it would seem that the
 demographic gap between jazz and rock is bigger than it was say 25 years ago
 fujii is one of a handful of artists including the aforementioned zorn black
 speed and douglas who would seem to have as many potential fans in the rock
 world as jazz things like raw energy and inspiration have never been exclusive
 to any musical genre and it would be a shame if the inspired creativity i hear
 on this album was only heard by a few jazz critics and japanese music fansits amazing the difference one little hyphen can make consider alsacelorraine
 is a region in france lying west of the rhine on the german border the
 oftdisputed region has changed hands dozens of times over the centuries and is
 home to one of the most colossal military failures of the 20th century the
 maginot line an imposing series of defenses intended to guard frances frontier
 from any german advance unfortunately for the french military in 1939 the
 germans had no qualms about simply conquering belgium and going around the
 maginot line rendering it useless
 
 but take away that hyphen and you have alsace lorraine a trio of chicagoans who
 make pleasant but ultimately bland pop music with a slight european affectation
 the bands songs are cut roughly from the same mold as those of stephin merritt
 unfortunately for alsace lorraine though it seems as though merritt hogged all
 of the memorable melodies for himself as a result the 16 songs on through
 small windows pass by like a single 40minute blur of meandering atmospheric
 pop in this instance atmospheric is not a compliment
 
 part of the problem may lie in the fact that caitlin brice simply doesnt make
 for a convincing frontwoman her voice is too wispy to ever come across as
 commanding and the words she sings too often get lost in the echoing background
 provided by hewson chen also a member of vitesse and paul francke the bands
 formula instantly brings to mind saint etienne comparisons and those comparisons
 hold up to a point however any saint etienne album will offer more variety and
 interest than this one
through small windows opens with you are like charles lindbergh to me
 though youd be hard pressed to differentiate it from much of what follows
 indeed often the most interesting aspect of the songs are the titles for
 instance name etched in homeroom chair and alex runs the world look
 promising but the loosely strummed guitars buried low in the mix and textured
 reverbdrenched synths dont really do much to back up brice as she attempts to
 convey the lyrics
 
 chalk marks on the ground manages to distinguish itself better than most of
 the songs here offering a more solid vocal hook than usual and a slightly more
 upbeat programmed drum rhythm but the bands overarchingly flaccid music doesnt
 do anything to help drive the writing home the lyrics look okay on paper too
 with passages like a heart is dead chalk marks are on the ground when they
 rolled away the stone to the tomb nobody was found fleshing out the story of
 a misfit rather nicely
 
 dreams i cant control the bands first recording with vocalist ruth welte
 also benefits from a slightly different approach though its actually difficult
 to tell weltes voice from brices without knowing about the difference first
 the trembling synths and midtempo moby beat rather unfortunately conjure images
 of lexuses travelling across white sands during primetime more than they recall
 the teenage heartbreak welte sings about note to darla marketing staff get on
 the phone to toyota
 
 further strengthening the stephin merritt comparison is though ive never seen
 you which sounds so much like something from the magnetic fields holiday
 that i keep expecting merritt to start singing youre the trouble ive been
 looking for at any second its followed by the albums closer the labour
 day parade though an instrumental with a slightly dubby feel that ranks as
 one of the groups most interesting offerings even if it cant quite hold my
 attention all the way through
 
 when the laser slides back across its track and the disc stops spinning nothing
 really lingers except perhaps for the somewhat gauzy feeling induced by the
 synthesizers through small windows proves so utterly innocuous that
 its hard to imagine anyone having any sort of opinion about it one way or
 another in the future alsace lorraine could use a little more maginot line
 in their sound something prickly or at least a little challenging to latch
 on to for now their music is the rough equivalent of leaving your corn flakes
 in the milk for too long and these flakes have turned into one big lump of mush
 sure you could eat it but why would you want toyoull just have to imagine the typical introduction illustrating evolution as
 a shaping factor in our lives addressing its musical manifestation as suggested
 by this groups darwinian name and album title the outline would take shape
 through the idea of natural selection with different genres like glitch and
 jungle occupying developmental niches in the survival of the fittest and the
 eventual epochal shift when one lifeform incorporates all those traits lets
 cut to the chase posthuman have recorded an awesome album one of the best
 idmoriented releases of 2001 all the more impressive that the uncertainty
 of the monkey is their debut and the first record for their label seed
 little is known about the duo but the music speaks for itself jacson of
 israelbeautiful beast begins unsettlingly with demonic blairwitchwarbling
 while minimal synth winds stir the air and disturbingly artificial snares create
 tension by panning between the channels regular and yet erratic then the hunt
 begins a disorienting rush of metallic crashes and whooming bass that descends
 into increasingly complex confields posthuman display more sonic range
 than autechre though evidenced as the frantic animal cooings are caught up in
 an austere keyboard melody a second more subdued section of the song begins
 and the elements slowly subtract themselves from the mix until the 10minute
 opener concludes in orchestral ambience
 15 seconds to get to spainhogan changes it up with mechanic hiphop beats
 funky as fuck met by a searing synth stab harder than anything elp cooked up
 on the can ox album last year posthuman have an uncanny knack for hiding
 minimelodies amongst all the wobbly bass and you can hear them on this track
 as a keyboard accent that lurked in the background gets looped over and over
 until it all ends in cycling claustrophobia they play with a very raw sound
 palette and so the digital sounds are far abstracted from any instrumental
 referents parts of their music imitate the jittering flow of download but
 without the emphasis on smackedup house rhythms
 when the instruments do reveal their origins as on quetzacotlgrathard debacle
 it comes startlingly as a harsh acoustic guitar strum appears over the clicking
 mandible chatter and floating keyboards so this isnt just a mlange of sounds
 thrown out at once each song has a highly narrative structure like hunting for
 signs of organic life in future sound of londons dead cities a hint of
 the human touch appears with the live version of this song on the last track
 you can hear a generic trance groove faintly in the background along with the
 duo fumbling at their decks and muttering back and forth then the actual song
 kicks in another beatdriven symphony of squelch
 thanks be to posthuman also for putting the dance back in intelligent dance
 music plethorafagans never never brings the funk with a litany of
 minimalisttechno breaks meanwhile wednesday stalks about the underbrush of
 booming bass and insectile glitch chirps then catches the scent of a presumably
 aphexian species it pivots and transforms into a stomping electro number acrid
 avid jam shredding in discombobulated fury and wrongfuleyes lures with
 preludetotheafternoonofafawn calmness before morphing into a nearindustrial
 anthem complete with dramatic keyboard vamps
the uncertainty of the monkey is anything but hesitant posthumans songs
 are overly confident and their dark spacious sound rises up from deep bass in
 the background a resonant synthesizer midrange and crisp beatscapes in the fore
 as a debut this album sets an aggressive mood but the cold atmosphere doesnt
 alienate instead theres the draw of a certain predatorial sexuality and in
 the deft combination of narrative structure dense sonic texture and progressive
 rhythm the duo have secured a place for themselves in idm history i wish there
 was more reconnaissance on them rumors abound about their affiliation with skam
 records and the bashes they host in londons aldwych disused underground station
 but if you follow the secret link on their homepage youll discover photos of
 the band and their mates living it up in various flats and generally looking
 like they havent a care in the world its a refreshing bit of humanity amongst
 all the cybernetic atmosphere and the glimpse of a poster of orbitals in
 sides on a back wall reveals another trace of familial historynamed after the corporate identity of the former chesapeake ohio baltimore
 ohio and western maryland railroads chessie are back with their third album
 of locomotive ambience and postrock caboosery far from being a fishpaste
 sandwichmunching trainspotter saddo stephen gardner chessies founding member
 makes railways sound kinda brainy gardner originally the bassist for dcs
 lorelei started this project as an outlet for his explorations into sound
 collage tape loop rhythms guitar noise and the similarity as he puts it
 between organic and constructed sounds and the way that railroads bisect the
 natural world with machinery
 
 chessies debut signal series won amazoncoms best dance and dj album
 for 1998 in gardners words the album sought to set up patterns of conflicting
 and interacting machinery in natural settings thus he allowed pummeling old
 school hardcore breakbeats to rampage through drifts of scorching ambience
 bolstered by the permanent addition of studio engineer ben bailes chessie toned
 the beats down for the farmore tortoisey meet an album for which the
 band never won a single gong after the release of meet andy ingalls a
 guest on meets brake test became a fulltime contributor to the group
 
 though the bands latest release overnight reprises the style of meet
 rather than signal series overnight is for me a more confident
 concentrated album chessie sound secure in leaving dead air this is nowhere
 better demonstrated than during ktower an anxious but investigative bassline
 searches through spines of guitar tweaks as though richie hawtin had remixed
 public image ltds albatross pantograph up takes the opposite tack and
 pushes white noise and fourtothefloor beats beyond the red zone in a loving
 homage to succourera seefeel
 
 s to u showcases the bands dexterity with a sixstring the track sounds like
 the cocteau twins shimmer blended with the sundays popnous with durrutti
 columns vini reilly on solo detail lineside roils like mains deep listening
 firmament cross harbor interchange launches off from loops of bursting white
 noise beneath which almost metronomic rhythmic pulses clatter as though an
 immense locomotive juggernaut is passing by the listener in this regard cross
 harbor interchange is an update of signal series clear block by
 contrast overnight takes a branchline trip into a fuzzedout ovalized
 version of enos music for airports with the sparse northern maine
 junction
 
 plug research have shown sound judgment in adding chessie to their roster though
 northern maine junction is the only overnight track that fits immediately
 within the labels aesthetic plug research recognizes talent as with labelmates
 soulo chessie now have the support and the encouragement to make the great leap
 after signal series and meet overnight contains few
 surprises its a logical progression from the groups previous releases and i
 have no quibble with its high quality but wheres the whiff of danger the
 thrill of the unknown its understandable that a band so influenced by railroads
 should wish to avoid derailment at all costs but sometimes riding hobostyle on
 risks runaway loco is what it takes to get you crashing into the festooned
 buffers of glory central stationafter about seven years of silence theres suddenly been a virtual flood of
 daniel johnston material first there was last years surprisingly coherent
 and successful rejected unknown followed by the reissue of jad fair and
 daniel johnstons 1989 collaboration its spooky a recent target ad
 even featured mary lou lord covering his speedy motorcycle and now comes
 the lucky sperms somewhat humorous the second such joint effort between
 texas favorite captain americaworshiping troubadour of questionable mental
 stability and the bespectacled half japanese founder and harry potter lookalike
 jad fair
 
 anyone familiar with the previous collaboration between these two or any of
 their other projects really probably knows what to expect with this one
 ragtag shambling songs most sounding halfcompleted and judging from the
 fidelity recorded on a talk boy the secondary title of this album has it just
 about right somewhat humorous somewhat annoying somewhat brilliant and
 somewhat scary are also good ways to describe it
 
 in a lot of ways the lucky sperms sounds pretty tossedoff interspersing
 maybe some leftover stuff johnston recorded during the last seven years with a
 few random jad fair tracks which isnt a totally bad thing johnston whose
 material comprises about half the album starts us off with movie a typical
 and typically moving pianobased ode to unrequited love and melancholia the
 harrowing death follows offering vivid glimpses into johnstons idiosyncratic
 and highlydeveloped mythic system
 
 jad for his part serves up five noisy stomping counterparts to johnstons
 piano melodies he also handles the albums production if you want to call it
 that his first contribution yes we can sounds more than a little like a
 johnston tune at least thematically contemplating batmans relative power and
 recalling what power is in the words the byrds asked bob dylan coffee
 cup meanwhile relates that peter pan refused to grow up i want more coffee
 in my coffee mug if you want treasure youve got to dug youve got to dug ya
 dig and what can you really say about that a truism if there ever was one
 
 midalbum the guys also pull out their covers including the beatles michelle
 and the stones ruby tuesday backtoback the former is given and laid back
 with an almost reggae rhythm and the french lyrics hilariously slurred through
 and ruby tuesday is given a barrelhouse piano reading by johnston near the
 end of the album they throw together a medley of standards and notsostandards
 called melody featuring bits and pieces of on top of old smokey simon and
 garfunkels bridge over troubled water aerosmiths take me to the other side
 bohemian rhapsody and dingdong the wicked witch is dead among others but
 even these pleasures are short lived theyre enjoyable enough in the moment but
 like the album as a whole i cant say ill be making the return trip very oftenthe mind is an amazing thing to this day for all our technical knowhow and
 scientific explorations we still understand very little about how it works
 still theres no denying its amazing capabilities from sheer storage capability
 and the power for reasoning to the oftdiscussed theories of telepathy and the
 strange but undeniably incredible stunts of your average savant it seems the
 brains powers are close to endless perhaps its most amazing feat of all though
 is its ability to convince itself of things it simply knows cannot be true like
 the urban legends about an alcoholic woman with nothing else to live for who
 carries around her dead baby cradling it and cooing its name convinced its
 still alive or the child who watches his father beat his mother but chooses
 not to acknowledge it finding it easier to believe it never happened than to
 deal with the repercussions or the thirtyyearold man who insists that
 professional wrestling is real or the music critic that convinces himself that
 theres no vocalist in fin fang foom
 and why not the music on texture structure and the condition of moods
 is interesting if not necessarily innovative granted this guitarbassdrums
 rock trio is hung up on that whole juxtaposition of the fast and slow and the
 abrasive and quiet and yes theyve been duped into thinking a casio keyboard
 part here and there will make them seem sensitive still the instrumentation is
 competent and on occasion some of these songs are even sort of interesting
 fin fang foom might not be up to the us maple standard for disjointed rock
 music but theyre certainly a step up from most of the generic crap that ends
 up festering in my review pile for weeks on end certainly a decent group like
 this would recognize the good things theyve got going for them and wouldnt go
 and fuck everything up by adding vocals right especially not really retching
 grating offkey vocals that bring to mind that forbidden eword nope theres
 just no reason and certainly they wouldnt have an equally incompetent backup
 vocalist showing up from time to time to take things from bad to simply
 unbearable nah theyd know better
 and even if for some godforsaken reason they insisted on adding vocals
 certainly theyd manage to find something less clich than oh i dunno angel
 love why so thin and pale dont you realize your soul is for sale right
 they would wouldnt they
 it seems safe to say that any group competent enough to master the tricky stops
 and starts and the leftfield time changes of songs like at age 23 and iron
 coat two of texture structure and the convocation of moods more
 intriguing moments would also realize that lyrics like laughing at my
 frustration realizing the truth no fear of confrontation a few more words
 then were through are painful in their mediocrity especially when followed
 by a refrain that goes i scrape my scars again my blood my one best friend
 and so like an emotionally deranged 15yearold who fervently insists that
 theres still a santa claus i maintain that fin fang foom has no vocalist
 after all i dont want to be mean contrary to popular belief we critics dont
 like writing negative reviews and these guys do have potential theyre like
 sweep the leg johnny just without the saxophone slightly more structured and a
 lot less interesting maybe one day theyll recognize the error of their ways
 focus on the instrumentals take the music down that road marked complexity they
 all seem to be eyeing with a bit of trepidation and who knows maybe theyll
 be worth a recommendation in the meantime ill just continue to enjoy these
 solid instrumentals thanks to the amazing power of selfdeceptioncontrary to what you may believe its hard to achieve a ranking this low your
 friends at pitchfork have an 879 successful suckage spotter and though
 there are occasionally some oversights both artists and critics have bad days
 were ultimately on your side kid there are some things you shouldnt have
 time or money appropriating in fact there are and i believe this deeply
 some things you just shouldnt have to hear
 
 the push kings feel no fade is rife with unanswered questions like for
 example why a mediocre indie pop quartet hates its audience so much that they
 would compose and construct this travesty or the reasons why the record label
 greenlighted its release mental fogginess due to drugs perverse and damaging
 sense of humor mob threats its anyones guess but they better have a pretty
 fucking good excuse
 
 i really wish i had never ever heard this
 
 the thing is ive been in a pretty good mood lately ordinary ups and downs of
 life notwithstanding and summoning up the mass of vitriol necessary for
 eviscerating this album the way it should be has required a considerable
 sacrifice of peace of mind on my part i figure this for a humanitarian gesture
 save yourself this album is so awful it hurt my feelings
feel no fade is appallingly glossy insipid vacuous cheesepuff pop
 music so bad it warrants negative musical comparisons to such luminaries as
 third eye blind and matchbox 20 apt description would necessitate me believing
 that there are more offensive and grotesque lapses of aesthetic judgment than
 the entirety of rob thomas career in order to convey my physical reaction to
 this album id have to draw up analogies to eating tablespoons of mayonnaise on
 an empty stomach after drinking a sixpack of peach flavored wine coolers and
 frankly thats not a leap im terribly excited about taking
 
 the supposed ideal audience for this album currently lives on a lackluster block
 of neutraltoned tract mansions in the suburbs of some forgettable
 brassandglass corporate banking metropolis her name is ashley she is
 thirteen years old and has recently become disillusioned with britney spears
 she dreams of turning sixteen years old so she can get a brand new bubblegum
 pink convertible no jeep no convertible with fuzzy leopard print seat covers
 and a matching cell phone and perhaps she can get a fun job at abercrombie and
 fitch for the employee discounts and access to like totally hot college boys
 on summer break she already knows which sorority she wants to pledge freshman
 year of college and thinks creed is a little too hardcore for me
 
 somehow or another her best friend and captain of the junior high cheerleading
 squad gets passed a copy of feel no fade and it becomes the soundtrack
 to ashleys life her longsuffering indulgent yuppie mom is forced to play
 track six honey come closer on the way to school every morning so her
 daughter can bounce along and imagine totally hot but nothing below the neck
 romantic encounters with guys that look like pacey from dawsons creek ashley
 and her friends paint their nails at slumber parties and choreograph amateur
 dance moves to beat girl and me and she knows all the words to summer
 trippin and pulls her boombox into the bathroom to sing to the cute
 doodoodoo chorus while showering and sometimes she stands in the bedroom
 mirror wondering if her stomach will ever be as thin as the tanned tattooed
 female torso which serves as the cover art for feel no fade she thinks
 maybe she would like to date one of the push kings
 
 unfortunately sometime around ashleys fourteenth birthday her interest starts
 to wane maybe the sparkling clean sugarcoated guitar line in rocket n time
 starts to sound a bit tired on the 400th listen or maybe despite their best
 intentions the push kings fail to interest the geniuses in charge of soundtracking
 the next wb teen drama or maybe she starts dating her nextdoor neighbor a
 barely postvoice change fifteenyearold boy he introduces her to jimmy eat
 world which compared to the push kings is deeply complex profoundly moving
 seriously hardcore and fraught with dangerous sexuality
 
 i usually think pure pop music is unfairly scorned its what it is an idle
 easy upper analogous to pixie stix or cake icing it can be addictive but
 thats usually tempered by our collective inability to digest that much sugar
 without uncomfortable side effects even the most pretentious music snob can be
 counted on for the occasional foray into the pastelhued and candycoated ignore
 their impossibly lame defenses and justifications pop music is great because you
 can like it without really having to explain why
 
 that being said feel no fade makes a strong case for strict eyeforaneye
 justice allowing all unwilling victims of its soulsucking commercial banality
 the privilege of publicly shaming their favorite push king there is absolutely
 no excuse for this shitthe dark ambient often we have hard beats and harder politics buried or not
 in the mix with the vocals most often piped in via dat or found sound we
 have guitars but theyre usually not playing like guitars opting for figures
 more remote and abstract than anthemic and how the synthesizers will drone on
 like troubled waters raging beneath all the distorted calm and alien footwork by
 which the faceless soldiers who articulate this music traverse above all i
 would say this kind of trip goes against the nature of nonaggressive expression
 because when youre playing stuff thats more likely to scare your constituents
 than sooth them chances are that your music will only get played by folks as
 dark or darker than you this means that whatever hard politics or soft terror
 you want to transmit is probably doomed to onetoone transmissions rather than
 grassroots populist revolution
 
 okay so dark ambient music may not be so inherently subversive at heart but
 when i think of many of its major proponents gybe keiji haino richard
 pinhas kk null nurse with wound i usually do think of spooky ultraserious
 exnoiseshamans who would sooner set fire to a government building than flash a
 smile and that much of this music features the beamedin sounds of samples
 field recordings and industrial commotion doesnt exactly lend it the human
 touch
 
 of course that may be the point entirely san franciscos elders of zion
 comprised of coconspirators joel schalit current editor of punk planet
 and exchristal methodist and asphodel records engineer vance galloway use
 these hallowed techniques to great effect seemingly to raise awareness of some
 brand of leftist political rhetoric though the impression of this is more
 evident than an actual agenda set forth now if revolution were the goal
 then it would make sense not to muddy the message with atonal atmospherics but
 to just come out and state your claims however if you just wanted to put a
 little scare on people then records like dawn refuses to rise would make
 a lot more sense theres something ominous on the horizon and i cant quite
 make out what it is but its bad its got serious politics and its going to
 get you
 
 elders of zion make their racket with traditional rock instrumentation put
 through gosh knows how many layers of postproduction and a library of
 spoken word samples ranging from american protest demonstrations to israeli
 children to godardobsessed french maoists if that sounds a bit heavy to
 you well it is but then the music albeit dark is never really angry or
 even all that loud so if you felt like tuning it out you probably could
 
 the title track wastes no time in painting it all black with screeching guitar
 lines and orchestras of basses and synths and big drums like the weird outro
 groove of the beatles strawberry fields forever and an imaginary soundtrack
 to airplanes landing next future avantgarde society despite being a lot
 faster is exactly as thick and suffocating as the previous tune throughout
 the record the band emphasizes their ability to turn any groove into a
 nightmarish vamp theres a sample in this one that goes the best noisemakers
 are not necessarily the best peacemakers damn right
 
 elsewhere things get a tad more chemically enhanced 1 in gaza this week
 with its sireneffects and pounding reverbladen beat could be some kind of
 tonepoem for innercity strife or some such relevant issue but mostly just
 seems like an acid test gone awry i could say the same for eject the push
 button punks rubber bullet rock and like a fish out of water which modify
 the lysergic groove with hispeed dnb beats reggae skank and sheer sonic
 pummeling via a restless snare and a manic electrodrone from synthesizer and
 guitar
 
 the biggest issue i have with this record is that the best parts hard beats
 endless arrays of psycheeffects and apocalyptic feedback can become a bit
 mindnumbing after a while to the point that they end becoming the worst parts
 drummer luis illades must have permanent bruises on his fingers from these
 sessions and i would hate to have coleaders joel schalit and vance galloways
 eardrums voluntarily subjected to hours of militant protest field recordings
 and far gone space effects again its not really that loud but they just
 never let up if you can handle the trip dawn refuses to rise can be a
 rather fascinating travel guide for journeys into the outer regionssincerely yours is a compilation of previously released exclusive and
 advance material from the roster of klein records a german electronic label
 founded in 1996 the collection holds together stylistically as none of the
 nine artists breaks far from sofachill mode but how many more chillout comps
 will i have to endure before i find any innovation
 the record begins in a slightly clubby mode with ukos automatic a midtempo
 house tune with a spliffy veneer excerpted from the bands 2001 selftitled
 album mikas trampolin continues the clubby trend with a genteel breakbeat
 and a horrendous street hawkperiod tangerine dream guitar line so far
 the droopyeyed set have nothing to fall into their couches over thats where
 the sofa surfers come in handy with a track snipped from their forthcoming
 encounters album the sofa surfers give toney stoners an anthem with
 river blues featuring the hemped vocals of jeb loy nichols nichols nasal and
 elongated vocal style works a treat when contrasted with a hienergy rhythm
 track such as the ewan pearson maas disco remix of nicols say goodbye to
 christopher but never has a singer described their own style more aptly as
 when nicols sings about muddy water on this soporific track
 albin janoska tries to emulate fat jon the ample soul physician with a
 headbobbing instrumental hiphop tune called lem soon to be adored by
 seldombathing sandalwearing eurorailers lem has the perfect balance of
 lowend theory and quivering strings garnished with a selfimportant tinkling
 piano line probably splendid after a eighth if im feeling charitable markus
 kienzl connects with the dub shacks of yore on top dog and scores the highlight
 of this disc after unleashing echoes kienzl lets rip a bassline that should
 have turned up on billy cobhams plundered spectrum lp with minimal
 percussive adornment kienzl lets the bassline suck you in for five minutes
 the only vocals here sound suspiciously sampled from paul mccartneys countin
 intro to the reprise of sgt peppers lonely hearts club band processed to
 sound like a really baked person fumbling their way to the number four
 then comes a track from seelenluft a guy with a penchant for dressing up in
 bunny costumes for his public appearances here he chimes in with more fumbling
 nonsense on manila in which an uncredited vocalist hollers about dancing
 without a seatbelt before someone with an amateur urge to be john mclaughlin
 cuts her off with his hamfisted display of plankspanking i do like manila
 by the way its goofiness redeems it and if nothing else it beats the piss
 out of the following track son of a gun
 son of a gun is by mum not the icelandic applied idm band but some duo
 sorely lacking in dignity and its another contribution to that already
 swollen clich the hollerin bluesman sampled and pasted into an incongruous
 midtempo house track mum at least altered the guitarline to sound like some
 sort of oud or gourd monochord and thereby making some statement about the west
 african roots of the blues or perhaps mum thought that gourdfashioned monochords
 somehow convey a hollerin mans sonofagun status more effectively that a
 plain ol guitar
 humbuckers thrill jockey rather than traipsing into the mines of originality
 opts to emulate linkin park and then lichtenbergs el duke with a mass of
 iconic latin and spaghetti western signifiers thankfully releases us from
 xfcmetal valhalla but for all the chacha maracas and hornblasts the song
 sounds nothing less than incidental music from a star trek fight sequence
 between james t kirk and some malevolent snaggletoothed alien beastie should
 go down well at your next office party then
sincerely yours a title which must clearly be in doubt after this motley
 array of tracks closes superbly with a new version of seelenlufts music for
 the stars hardly different from the blissful ultramarineasawurlitzeroutfit
 version that appeared on last years synchronschwimmerep the track
 deftly highlights what klein is capable of releasing when not bogged down in

 go go ahead and try to find all the boredomsrelated projects i dare you
 while youre at it why dont you get another job because most of the
 superrare releases by these units will run you about 35 a pop boredoms
 marketing has got the whole supplyanddemand thing down so why would they ever
 bother with distribution but thats overly cynical as with most impulsively
 creative musicians these people just never stop working
 
 oh yes theres also ooioo the boredoms connection here is drummertrumpet
 player yoshimi pwe the oband is something of a solo project for yoshimi
 as she produces everything and writes most of the music along with her partners
 kyoto maki and yoshiko they have three albums and each one sounds
 progressively similar to recent boredoms with plenty of electronic fiddling and
 spaceage suncrash drum stomp but with the major difference being
 yoshimi doesnt take eyes scenic route as a means via extended warp drive
 exploration and jungle hunt ooioos journey always ends up closer to pop than
 boredoms with a penchant for new wave chic and boisterous singsong melodies
shock city shockers 2 on eyes shock city imprint is comprised of
 remixes of tunes from the bands three previous albums and one new tune open
 your eyes you can fly which actually sticks out a little on this release not
 featuring the electronic wizardry of the others the cast assembled to restir
 the mixtures is itself a mixture of old bore cohorts and new characters but
 theres something that nags me about the release in general its not that the
 music isnt interesting to listen to there are lots of headphonefriendly
 details and sonic logic games to play its just that i cant help but think
 that since ooioos albums always seemed at least a step away from greatness
 and since they always seemed to be in debt to the recent boredoms sound rather
 than an extension of it injecting them with electric steroids is misleading
 for me most of the music on this album sounds better than the originals take
 that as you will
 
 tenkuteku tunemountain book two tunes from the 2000 release gold and
 green is a very nice way to begin the album we have a sine wave courtesy
 of remixer zak floating over the top of the speakers announcing the heady
 arrival of sunny ambient flangeguitar and light synth its conceptually
 similar to the last track from boredoms super ae and placing such an
 offhandedly warm track at the beginning is a daring move how could you follow
 something so completely at ease hmmm
 
 later on semihyperactivity rears its head another very different version of
 mountain book remixed by chari chari features a kinetic drum loop somewhat
 like a techno indian raga beat and yoshimis echoridden vocals sent to all
 corners of the mix asozan from feather float is given the rolling
 tom treatment by remixer eye beginning with restless marimba all cartoonish
 steve reich motives and insistent pulse it moves on to a fairly detached
 doubletracked yoshimi vocal again sent to various points kinorokujyouressya
 reworked by frequent borecollaborator kiyoshi izumi actually gets fairly close
 to straight techno with a bouncy breakbeaten rhythm and all the hiccup glitch
 you could want on the dancefloor
 
 other tracks are quite restrained unu green and gold remixed by
 woodman is heavy on the 80s drum machine and delayed tremolo guitar and is
 virtually without vocals however the beat is downplayed in favor of druggy
 atmospherics like the various atonal synthlines you can barely hear in the
 background but which nevertheless give the tune a very tangibly hazy quality
 be sure to loop feather float remixed by tatsuki masuko of asln and
 dub squad fame begins very similarly to the first tune all warm with bells
 birds and typically detached vocals after several minutes of this the drums
 come in and bingo it becomes like an outtake from vision creation newsun
 with the onechord guitar vamp over pounding neu drums and the omnipresent
 electric effects someone in this camp should apply for a patent on this sound
 because its going to get ripped off very soon
 
 if pressed to place this album in a canon with other boredoms side projects
 id reference three firstly eyes dj pica pica pica release with which
 shock city shockers 2 shares an affinity for offbeat combinations of
 melody and rhythm though this record could never rule a party like the pica
 secondly the first shock city shockers which was a collection of
 remixes of several bands music and thirdly boredoms 1996 release super
 roots 6 with which it shares a command of ambience and the juxtaposition of
 simplistic structures and melodies with seemingly complex studio techniques
 and while ooioos remix album is nice i would recommend those records firstsometime during the stonegrey early months of 1985 the members of xtc stumbled
 upon a time portal manifested in the form of a wardrobe in captain sensibles
 cobbled and thatched suburban london cottage what the band was doing there no
 one can say but as they stepped inside the portal making their way past row
 after row of paisley frocks and multihued fourinhand ties they were
 transported to the year 1967 emerging from the wc of a downtown gogo club
 
 as luck would have it the clubs house band was absent that particular evening
 all four had fallen ill with mononucleosis so the lads in xtc had no trouble
 convincing management to allow them to take the stage having committed a fair
 share of the eras repertoire to memory they aided on drums by guitarist david
 gregorys brother ian who happened to be with the band that fateful morn at the
 wardrobe won the crowd over easily and it wasnt long before they secured some
 studio time
 
 christening themselves the dukes of stratosphear and renaming themselves
 individually as sir john johns partridge the red curtain moulding lord
 cornelius plum david gregory and eiei owen ian gregory the band whipped
 up an eps and an lps worth of dainty psychedelic pop songs inspired like no
 other time in their careers the dukes were truly of their era yet wholly xtc
 whimsical bright and trippy but also wry subtly sarcastic even time travel
 couldnt change that and sophisticated it was as if they themselves were
 inventing the very band that would later inspire and influence their proper
 albums
 
 fortunately before they were suddenly and unexpectedly jerked back to 1985 in
 the middle of a rehearsal the dukes had the foresight to hide their session
 tapes under a stack of pat boone records at a local shop and there they remained
 until xtc could pick them back up during the thatcher administration the ep
 25 oclock was released later that year while the remaining ten tracks
 came out two years later on the psonic psunspot lp both were eventually
 collected in their entirety on chips from the chocolate fireball which
 has been recently reissued by virgin
 
 the above story must be what happened what else could explain this prime
 vintage psychedelia released during the decidedly unpsych mid1980s what
 else could explain songs like bike ride to the moon with lines like and
 well pack a tent cause its cold at night and ill share your sleeping bag
 if i might and might be a positive boon to protect you from the man in the
 moon the small faces couldnt have put it better and how to explain the
 lack of much if any of the stench of 80s production values
 
 you might think this is a pure joke project on the order of spinal taps listen
 to the flower people but play this album alongside say pink floyds
 a saucerful of secrets or the zombies odessey and oracle and
 youll find that parody or not its a great collection of songs that more than
 measures up
 
 to put it bluntly if you can only have one xtc album by presidential mandate or
 something this is the one thats not a jab at xtc theyve delivered more than
 their fair share of outstanding releases in their day english settlement
 and skylarking to name only two but theres always been a handful of
 mediocre songs on each album that could stay or go not here all 16 are
 kaleidoscopic pop gems it stands as a testament to the bands quirky genius
 that their loving parodytribute side project just happens to be responsible for
 the best music theyve ever madeas much as i dont want to admit it the new mouse on mars ep is just going
 through the motions see its not that agit itter it it is all that
 bad by anyone elses standards its pretty excellent work but after such a
 long distinguished string of releases culminating in last years muchlauded
 idiology the five tracks contained here are kind of a letdown most
 mouse on mars albums use the ideas of the previous one as a launching point
 for the exploration of new sonic territory and while the sounds used to
 construct the songs on agit itter it it do bear a strong resemblance to
 those on idiology and were likely created during the same sessions
 theyve clearly been made bsides for a reason
 
 milleader is somewhat interesting finding andi toma and jan st werner
 juggling jagged samples bleating synths programmed beats and assorted other
 noises with the expertise of firstclass powerbookers unfortunately this isnt
 the case elsewhere untitled states of is built around a distorted keyboard
 loop and a few repeated guitar riffs as the song progresses a bass part and
 sequenced percussion find their way into the mix while assorted layers of noise
 hover above problem is the beats holding it together are somewhat repetitive
 and generic at least by the standard set in the duos previous work and the
 occasional pitchshifting and feedback fails to make that distinction between any
 old idm track and mouse on mars mastery
 
 more telling still by far the most interesting track on agit itter it it
 entitled moral sack it is no more than a minute long a handful of trumpets
 enter and fade leaving behind garbled electronic feedback in their wake like a
 path of slime following a snail before giving way to the fractured beat that
 begins the next song while little more than a transition this is the only
 moment on the ep that truly demonstrates the kind of ingenuity present in the
 majority of mouse on mars work
 
 in fact the real highlight here is not the ep at all but the live seveninch
 that comes packaged with the discs first pressing toma and st werner have
 gained a reputation as the best live performers in the electronic world
 offering live instrumentation and an intriguing visual setup rather than relying
 on the standard guytablelaptop scenario that characterizes most idm shows the
 addition of live drums vocals from dodo nkishi and other instrumentation to the
 usual laptops and sequencers allows these guys to reinterpret their work in ways
 that most electronic acts cannot but they do more than just add a voice and
 manipulate some beat structures the passion and energy driving the live version
 of actionist respoke here is undeniably human replacing the alien aesthetic
 of the original with something different yet oddly familiar though a live
 recording is typically a weak substitute for honesttogod new music these two
 cuts work better than anything presented on the ep
 
 perhaps in the end the best way to explain agit itter it it is the
 oldfashioned way its an ep and like most eps agit itter it it
 ultimately gets branded with the dubious for completists only stamp if you
 dont already have a vast collection of mouse on mars proper albums your
 wellearned funds will be better spent elsewherethere are albums you love and there are albums you hate somewhere between east
 and west are the albums that neither pleasure your eardrums nor puncture them at
 best these albums are ordinary at worst theyre obnoxious unfailingly
 these records add little to the great panoply of the grand experience we call
 music and in a world where 35000 albums are released each year they not only
 occupy vital shelf space but their mere existence exacerbates the already
 challenging task of discovering true brilliance they are anathema to our noble
 cause and as a result we ought to attack them like cokedup mongooses
 
 today comrades i am your mongoose and reclinerland is my field mouse
 
 from track one vocalist and songwriter mike johnson is frontandcenter his
 songwriting style not surprisingly wont shatter your notion of consonance
 the first track miss haze features johnson and his acoustic guitar strumming
 lazily through a groundbreaking gc progression the progression doesnt change
 by the end johnson is still strumming a measure of g then a measure of c then
 a measure of g then a measure of c you get the idea
 
 many arrangements on reclinerland approximate the twochord progression of miss
 haze with johnson selfconsciously moaning in the foreground commonplace
 arrangements would be fine if reclinerland was a melodyfocused effort but as
 far as i can tell its not and if it is someone needs to adjust the sharpness
 
 pound coins shows off another of johnsons weaker points a smidge of
 tonedeafness when he gets courageous and tries singing some high notes the
 chorus i walked along mispronouncing all the funny names hes clearly just
 a bit flat some call it cute and endearing i call it annoying pound coins
 isnt the only manifestation of the disability either it shows up regrettably
 on more than a few tracks 19th century boy and dirty and clean for example
 
 my campaign against mediocrity notwithstanding can i say nice things about
 reclinerland sure i can sidenote i can also say nice things about lifehouse
 in and of itself and in the hands of an unbiased listener read not me this
 stuff aint bad the lyrics are often poetic and appealingly witty like this
 lyric from eight i must have walked around in circles for a matter of days
 i think ive broken the record for just standing in one place i think ive lost
 all the feeling in the right side of my brain its hard to explain
 unfortunately they can also be as trite as the chord progressions like the
 jimmy vinspired i want you so badly dont give up dont give up from meet
 me later in the file room
 
 in addition to strong lyrics a few of the songs pull it all together like
 vegas remains which fingerpicks instead of strumming a chord progression
 and adds some sentimental schmaltz about how johnson knows were really just
 eight pages whatever that means finally the man strikes a consistent mood
 sweet and thoughtful that im certain resonates with at least a few of the
 under25 crowd
 
 there are good reasons i dont drive a chevy caprice classic eat wonder bread
 live in iowa or root for vinny testaverde for roughly the same reasons you
 wont find me lavishing in the mellow hues of reclinerland a pleasant listen
 but pleasant is about as far as im willing to go with this oneone of the most exciting things about being addicted to music is the joy of discovery its a ritual that
 we put ourselves through again and again scouring the bargain bin for that lost treasure countless
 magazines piling up in our rooms sucked of their suggestive power and lately cdrs filled with obscurities
 from a friends computer the need for new sounds is as addictive as the music itself and whether its the
 attention paid to overlooked classics or the apparent demise of the record industry or both we addicts
 are treated to legitimate rediscoveries from time to time
 
 last year former gogos guitarist charlotte caffey and anna waronker daughter of label guru lenny waronker
 and exfrontwoman of that dog started up a record label dubbed five foot two records so now after
 releasing a solo album this summer annas done the rock world a great service by reissuing redd kross
 long outofprint 1987 classic neurotica and what with anna and charlotte being married to the
 brothers steve and jeff mcdonald the core members of redd kross the reissue shines with the light of
 careful consideration
 
 the album was recorded with producer tommy ramone listed in the liner notes under his birthname tommy
 erdelyi but when their label big time folded soon after the records promotion suffered leaving it
 relatively unheard by the masses and to later become cult classic as with most overlooked records its
 power was channeled through other artists these days neurotica is regarded as a prime influence on
 the early 90s grunge movement sub pop once contracted the posies jon auer to remix the album for a
 rerelease during the seattle boom but the project was not meant to be
neurotica exuded a janus quality found in the best pop music it looked forward and equally embraced
 the past it was the missing link between big star and the pixies a perfect blend of a 70s saturday morning
 sugar rush and 80s california punk pop culture nostalgia was to redd kross what lsd was to the butthole
 surfers their music was delivered with just as furious a passion but their love for beatlesesque pop
 harmony shone through as much as any punk sensibility and their kinks influences entirely free of irony
 served as lyrical substance over their powerful hioctane hooks
 
 leading with its title track lifted from the beatles sgt peppers lonely hearts club band reprise
 and complete with liverpudlian countoff neurotica is definitive redd kross coupling undulating
 melody and a sweetly harmonized bridge remember bridges with a screaming chorus and the result is as
 abrasive as it is catchy love is you the albums sole acoustic number is as much a tribute to a girl
 as to love songs themselves its tongueincheek falsetto delivery sounds alternately comic and passionate
 peach kelli pop a beatlesviabadfinger raveup boasts the best swaggering vocals this side of paul
 westerberg its lyrics illustrating just how far from the then everpresent sunset strip ethos redd kross
 were everybody take a ride in your mamas car lets go to the troubadour pretend were seein stars
 man were cruisin hollywood do you get the joke laughin at all the assholes at the rainbow flyin
 so high on coke what a joke
 
 theres an innate sense of joy at the heart of neurotica at times the hardcore riffing teeters a
 bit too close to hollywood hair metal but when its balanced by such undeniably fucking brilliant pop hooks
 and choruses whos complaining the mcdonald brothers sense of melody and song structure is solely
 responsible for the albums charm and in this world of haircuts and target marketing its good to be
 reminded that no matter the era every metropolitan underground produces phenomenal records even 1987
 laremember when mtv was still that little renegade music channel i vividly
 recall sitting in front of the tv when i was a kid entranced for hours by
 twisted sister def leppard and quiet riot videos and though i wasnt entirely
 sure about what was going on in front of my eyes i was fascinated all the same
 to think that there were places where grown men ran around in makeup and spandex
 and still managed to kick total rock ass these were guys that acted completely
 insane yet took themselves seriously and were fawned over by women everywhere
 as a child it was like a portal into a strange parallel universe where all of
 my small town values were inverted
 
 then there was the other breed of mtv musician synthpop guys who seemed more
 like real artist types and didnt seem to be concerned as much with making a
 fantastic testosteronesoaked spectacle of themselves as creating seductive and
 melodic music naked eyes human league talk talk they seemed so cutting
 edge with their roland synths and electronic drumpads and the sounds they
 created were something entirely new at least to popular music sorry i wasnt
 listening to brian eno and kraftwerk when i was 10
 
 this was the type of stuff that really interested me but somewhere along the
 line synthpop began its long estrangement from melody and electronica began
 to take over it started innocuously enough but soon began incorporating more
 beat manipulation and studio effects until it was finally twisted into the form
 known today as idm i miss those early days when the technology didnt rule the
 product and i think its time we saw some songwriters doing a little taking
 back its time for a rebirth of synthpop wherein all the new innovations in
 electronic music are employed in the service of melody
 
 as my posterchild for this movement i select hood i also accept donations
 cold house takes a fantastic batch of songs and intelligently mixes in
 cutting edge electronic elements a la autechre and nobukazu takemura a couple
 of west coast underground hiphop artists and some delicate backing arrangements
 and creates one of the most innovative releases of the past year
 
 the biggest surprise on cold house is the guest spots by anticon mcs
 doseone and why im not sure how hood hooked up with the san francisco
 rappers but their inclusion here was a brilliant decision the duos scat
 lyrics and drumnbass delivery really temper the album preventing it from
 becoming too soft at points chris hoods lead vocals arent very inspiring
 falling limply somewhere between badly drawn boy and bernard sumner but by
 mixing in the slit cut vocals spoken word and psychobabble riffing a perfect
 contrast is created between the them
 
 the album opens promisingly with they removed all trace that anything had
 happened here a nice mix of delicate startstop clicks jangly guitar and
 tasteful cello arrangements the song splits the vocal sections starting first
 with chris hood and then handing everything over to doseone who drones over a
 repeated vocal loop whose compelling nature lies in its unintelligibility you
 show no emotion at all kicks off with an unimaginative scratchy beat but soon
 picks up with nice trumpet and keyboard fills revealing itself as the strongest
 track on the album that strictly features hoods own vocals
 
 with branches bare
 thrives on a distended drone that sounds clipped straight from depeche modes
 violator halfway through doseone hops in with his nasal tone and
 surreal lyrics we spit in the pond to give the fish something to pray to
 sometimes the sunset doesnt want to be photographed we are no tigers in the
 pickedbone grasslands but the albums standout comes with the closing track
 youre worth the whole world its sung entirely by doseone over a lowmixed
 spoken track a simple picked guitar progression and hushed horn keyboards that
 lead in from the melancholy preceding track lines low to a frozen ground
 
 there are some misses in the middle of the album like the river curls around
 this town a track that while never really amounting to much does end with
 some nice richly atmospheric electronic gamelan sounds indeed all of the
 tracks on cold house even the weaker ones contribute something of
 interest take for instance i cant find my brittle youth which might
 amount to little more than filler if not for the machine gun drumming that comes
 out of nowhere and closes the track like john bonham at 78rpm
 
 since their inception in 1994 hood havent been able to make up their minds
 what kind of band they want to be over the course of their past four albums
 not to mention their countless singles eps compilation appearances remix
 records and collections theyve jumped indecisively from genre to genre
 experimenting with shoegazer straightforward indie rock slowcore and lofi
 but with cold house hood seem to have finally stumbled into a sound all
 their own melding their countless influences into something totally unique and
 at last giving music fanatics and critics worldwide a reason to look forward
 to their future releases lets hope the payoff is this good next time aroundi dont get the indie rock fetish for nautical imagery its usually not even
 appropriate june of 44s punchy sound was far from the fluid motions of naval
 life rachels epic the sea and the bells must have marked a turning
 point because since then i admit to having heard a diffusion of its effects in
 louisvillerelated projects like the shipping news but then there are bands
 like volta do mar whose knifesharp transmissions are more appropriate for a
 turn on the highway than the sea maybe steppenwolfs born to be wild and
 rushs red barchetta forever closed that road to the scene
 
 victory at sea argue otherwise on carousel the vibe on the trios second
 fulllength shifts without warning from warmth to biting cold and on the most
 emotionally gripping songs lyrical hints of roadtrip imagery are tied to the
 breakup of a relationship its dark rock in the vein of the afghan whigs im
 thinking particularly of the guest vocals of scrawls marcy mays on my curse
 victory at sea frontwoman mona elliott croons with a similar ache on the opener
 third place her guitar meanders softly with shuffling percussion in the
 beginning as she sings from one place to another not one word to each other
 drummer fin moore and bassist mel lederman weave rolling rhythms together
 accelerating into a fiery chorus as elliott admits that she cant repress memory
 forever
 
 elliotts voice also reminds me of a sweeter thalia zedek short of a few
 thousand packs of cigarettes turns out to be an appropriate connection
 lederman played piano on zedeks been here and gone and zedek returns
 the favor in the company of a chorus of women for the conclusion of the open
 road moore proves his prodigious skill on this song cycling through a series
 of rolls and crashes like an eightarmed vedic god his propulsion only enhanced
 by the brooding plod of the bass the sun hit the windshield like a rock from
 the sky elliott remembers her only lyric in the song then the inevitable
 pause patience and the soaring chorus and climax that never fails to send a
 chill up my spine
 
 whereas the previous songs begin at one destination and end entirely at another
 the blizzard of 78 is victory at seas most pop song elliotts guitar
 chimes almost cheerily as she describes her street buried in snow the sun it
 reflected from the ice to the windows and antennas from the cars shot through
 the new higher ground it was the last time i remember us together two
 verses two choruses and then a punchy melody at the ending that will leave you
 humming for hours but unsure whether youre happy or just damned miserable too
 bad every song cant quite match that lyricism the driver builds well with
 a bluesy riff and shimmering cymbals moore kicks in transforming the piece to
 a stomping rocker but elliott loses steam you can drive much faster than me
 i am sometimes much older
 
 but the rest of the songs lead the listener through more convoluted paths
 angel opens with a muted trumpet and amidst the slow tense rhythm elliott
 sings of wings homemade crocheted out of hearts of the other jealous angels
 the song cuts short before more can be revealed but likewise on the closer
 mermaid she warns that they need water to breathe but the water has
 spilled out you dont need to flesh out these curious figures to enjoy the
 turbulent drums and scraping feedback on this final track remember two
 tracks before might have been a more appropriate closer though with ledermans
 electric piano echoing like a bittersweet disintegration ballad i worry
 that my words havent done justice to this excellent album just imagine a cold
 winter in the bands hometown of boston and all the icy intensity and seasonal
 weariness that might entail in case it wasnt obvious this is one for the
 roadits late 1995
 
 youre a couple months shy of twenty years old and though technically a college
 student you cant remember the last time you attended a class you spend your
 evenings driving back and forth to the wellknown college town approximately
 45 miles to the east of your current residence for name musical events or
 attend loud sloppy punk rock shows at a dilapidated house two blocks from your
 own mediocre state university you know the place right some falldown joint
 with a rotting front porch overflowing with rusty bicycles and mildewed sofas
 youre not really sure whos paying rent or if anyone is paying rent at all
 the place smells like shit and the show attendees drive you crazy with their
 politics and gratuitous displays of testosterone chances are if youre female
 youre the clear minority but its better than bickering with your roommate
 over rent and every now and then you have a really great time
 
 its the messy nostalgia factor and karps posthumous singles collection
 action chemistry reminds me of all the sweaty drunken nights i spent
 trying like hell to not get trampled and the times i surprised everyone though
 mostly myself when i loudly declared during the silence at the end of the show
 goddamn that fucking rocked
 
 i didnt see karp in 1995 the bands i saw then were usually loud but lacking
 both musical proficiency and a sense of humor karp was endowed with an impressive
 amount of both much has been made of their metal influences think the bastard
 child of the melvins and black sabbath occasionally joined by a hardcoreloving
 session musician with an affinity for uppers black flag and animal from the
 muppet show and as for the humor thing well its hard not to like a band
 that adds a detail like this in the liner notes recorded with a live bear in
 the studio that was tough
 
 in fact disliking this band is difficult when you find yourself raising the
 devil horns and headbanging in earnest to turkey named brotherhood with its
 deadon fucking metal guitar line and unintelligible screamed vocals
 its hard not to laugh and its okay because you know karp is laughing with
 you
 
 in their day karp were notorious for their wrestlingwear and lyrical allusions
 to the wizard of oz and the roller derby they recorded three fulllengths
 for k attracted some rather highprofile fans within the music community built
 to spills doug martsch has been spotted wearing karp tshirts on numerous
 occasions and allowed their fans the pleasure of ballsout rock and roll
 absurdity without having to prefix the pleasure with guilty consider the
 opener rowdy the first track on karps last ep a completely brutal totally
 hilarious alcoholic older cousin of the fucking champs proggedout meditations
 on the same genre this track makes terrific use of its technical intricacy
 never wiping the smirk off its face
 
 with karp the silliness factor tempers the bombast just enough that you can sit
 back on second listen and enjoy the hodgepodge of sounds beneath the noise
 without feeling like too much of a hesher both dusk and blue blood employ
 the dirgetoexplosion quietloud dynamics of the artier set but allow for all
 the strutting metal affectations to seep through likewise the speed metal
 uproar of gauze resolves itself into a raucous classic rock kind of conclusion
 which would be completely preposterous if not for its defiantly lofi sound
 the album fills out with a virtually unintelligible black flag cover nothing
 left inside and the terrifically titled id rather be clogging with its
 slowtobuild fullon guitar assault at the conclusion
action chemistry might lack subtlety but thats sort of the point isnt
 it i mean if youre looking for breezy complex pop songs this obviously
 isnt the place to go this is not music for the merlot crowd its loud and
 unruly and if they ever invent scratchandsniff cds this one would smell like
 the interior of a shitty dive the morning after an amateur cockrock show but
 the damn thing charmed me something about undistilled rock without the bells
 and whistles something about being sure these guys had a lot of fun doing this
 something about the way it makes me want to stock my pockets with cheap beer and
 go to a bad house show just to make sure im not missing anything really great
 
 goddamn that fucking rockedman look at those guys obviously not to be fucked with that one guy in the
 middle looks like the leader hes just sitting there smoking a cigarette
 paying no attention to the fact that the two gentlemen standing to either side
 of him are about to kick someones ass theres a bear head on the wall the guy
 with the plaid shirt and the big belt probably wrestled it to the ground with
 his own two hands and slowly removed its head with a swiss army knife while the
 guy with his hands over his crotch cheered him on these are the kind of guys
 who if they saw you in a dark alley would be too busy not giving a fuck about
 you to kick your ass
 
 looking at the cover of world of gold its fun to imagine that the boys
 of nerves are true rustic badasses unfortunately only one syllable in the
 phrase true rustic badasses really rings true about this cd world of
 gold is an utterly unspectacular plodding and flatout boring attempt at
 rough rock swagger though there are a few glimpses of inspiringly competent
 songwriting this is an album that at its very very best brings to mind
 phrases like inspiringly competent
world of gold opens with the infuriatingly uneven 10 feet tall starting
 with a riff thats about as fresh as weezers hash pipe vocalist rob datum
 pulls out his best semiretarded iggy pop affectations its certainly not awful
 but it doesnt exactly grab your attention either after a while some wellplaced
 slide guitar hints at greater things but that hint is never taken and the song
 immediately slides back into its stale riffage and later another shift towards
 more interesting songwriting is interrupted by a solo that sounds like it could
 have been played by a 12yearold guitar student whos still discovering the
 wonders of the pentatonic scale
 
 suffering highway and behind the trees are similarly boring the former being
 absolutely unmemorable and the latter being rather annoying sloppy playing is
 fine but sloppy slide guitar can lead to an unwanted foray into microtonal music
 behind the trees closes with an absolutely unnecessary instrumental passage
 complete with vibraphones something that may or may not have been specified in
 their contract when they signed with thrill jockey tacking on vibraphones to
 clumsy endlessly repetitive garage rock does nothing but emphasize the complete
 lack of original ideas that plagues this album
 
 ill give them this much occasionally on a track like take it nerves manage
 to pull off some sufficiently convincing sloppy rock most of the time though
 when world of gold does manage to grab your attention which is rare it
 isnt in a positive way other bands like clinic and the white stripes have
 managed to successfully adopt a similar aesthetic by bringing their own innovation
 andor energy to the mix but without the benefit of either of these world of
 gold is about as convincing as pyrite and ten times as dullat some point we all idolize celebrities thats the nature of our icondriven
 culture and for all the media glut legitimate heroes the kind who do
 something more than sing act or kick footballs are kind of hard to come by
 i fell victim to such pop idolatry after letting go of the madonna fascination
 around late sixth grade i moved onto other idols eventually settling on a
 couple of kims deal and gordon to be exact in high school so i can sympathize
 with international noise conspiracy frontman dennis lyxzen who wears his
 celebrity crush on his sleeve its kind of endearing really i mean out of
 all the celebrities and quasicelebrities in rock and roll today he picked the
 exnation of ulyssesexmakeup singer ian svenonius
 
 of course theres a fine line between idolatry and obsession and im guessing
 the only thing stopping lyxzen from going through the garbage outside the
 svenonius household is geography sweden is quite a ways from dc and due to
 the corporate nature of air travel im sure lyxzens anticapitalist politics
 would hinder a jetsetting lifestyle of course the international noise
 conspiracys capitalism stole my virginity appears with some regularity on
 m2 so what the hell do i know
 
 unable to follow up on his obsession in first person present tense lyxzen seems
 to have arrived at the conclusion that his only choice is to become ian svenonius
 a goal easily enough achieved with the right combination of hair products and
 likeminded cohorts first he would form a loud angry band refused that
 would release records with retro cover art and lengthy manifestoes as liner
 notes and mediate the obvious similarity to nation of ulysses by throwing in
 some heavy metal and electronica for kicks that band would release two albums
 and be followed up with another band which would trade in the screaming and
 noise for danceable soulinfused garage rock tunes the new band would require
 members to wear tight flared trousers cultivate a highly stylized look and
 sound and get a pretty girl who had previously played in a feisty allfemale
 band with a complicated retro hairdo to join the team and there you have it
 the makeup erm i mean the international noise conspiracy
 
 the sound of these two bands is so totally similar i doubledare you to listen
 to the title track on the first conspiracy the noise conspiracys recently
 released compendium of early eps and see if you cant imagine an obscure makeup
 tribute band covering a rejected track from destination love its all
 there lars stromberg playing pseudojames canty with spare throwback guitar
 hooks the simple yet funky rhythm section and of course lyxzens occasionally
 squealing delivery
 
 simply put thats the formula and youll find little variance on any of the
 first conspiracys twelve tracks save an occasional chanted singalong
 timebomb or a foray into slightly punker territory black mask
 in fact the only factors saving this disc from being a total rehash of all your
 favorite makeup moments are the following 1 for better or worse james brown
 vocalizing doesnt translate so well to swedish 2 theres a keyboard and
 3 the lyrics
 
 indeed if you like your music heavy on the anarchocommunist polemic then
 certainly this is the band for you for example in the sin crusade lyxzen
 squeals noise in this case the idea of the subversive sounds that could in
 difference with the regular pop group serve as an attack against musics
 function as the spectacle the only way we can even begin to play the
 revolutionary game thats a song lyric folks lyxzen gets technical in
 i swear if u do which even looks like a makeup title by including
 footnoted dates and a quotation from engels within the body of the song
 
 truly the first conspiracys lyric sheet would function beautifully as
 a sly parody of political rock music problem is theyre dead serious in
 flared pants and the only thing i can figure is that the sense of humor of
 the noise conspiracys dc idols was lost in translation also to say this
 political earnestness is something of a killjoy would be a massive understatement
 in the end you find yourself giggling at the lyrics and wondering if such
 imitation isnt well kind of sadits an orgy something that may not have been designed for mass consumption
 but is nevertheless creating and recreating at a rapid pace that rejects even
 the most sincere attempts at canonization the members of this party interact
 and exchange various phenomena without a shred of cautious foresight and what
 results is more fruitful and volatile and reactive than any one elements could
 ever have been alone i imagine the streets in koenji must be crawling with
 taste police on the lookout for illegal crosspollination and conceptridden
 incestuous marriages that the kids who are voluntarily dropping out of the
 material world for riskier exhibitions must live in constant paranoia that their
 night lives will be used against them when the numbercrunching begins or
 worse that nobody will listen when its their turn to play
 but unbeknownst to their more conservative brethren who would settle for the
 occidental tourism of western pop as scripture these kids cousins and artful
 clergymen are making something new under the empire of the sun this is not
 manufactured and its certainly not criminal but it is in fact quite
 extraordinary these wildly informed noise shamans in the age of supposed
 information sharing have beaten american democratic spirit at its own game
 im talking about unselfish art and the exchange of ideas im talking about
 todays japanese independent music
 okay so maybe i romanticize this stuff a bit but its not for any love of
 melodrama as i can assure that i enjoy reading about someones obscure fetishes
 about as much as you do no the musicians working underground back east pique
 my interest mostly due to renegade originality and purity of expression in the
 face of drastic underexposure for example when i heard the story of drummer
 tatsuya yoshidas first rehearsal with his then unnamed band wherein the
 guitarist didnt show up and he decided to go with only himself and a bassist
 for the subsequent 15 years as ruins i took notice or when i read about how
 after more than a decade of praise from the alternative press boredoms frontman
 yamatsuka eye still doesnt think his band plays well enough doesnt understand
 why people call his music noise and is constantly striving for the next new
 sound i was struck these are stories of people who refuse to accept the
 mundane practical or given its easy to romanticize a scene that offers no
 guarantees of fame and yet whose members are as in love with their art as any
 detached fanatic
japanese independent music is an ambitious undertaking by the french label
 sonore although there have been samplers of experimental japanese music before
 its never been easy for western audiences to find information about the music
 sonore head franck stofer packaged this album with a book of the same title thats
 a virtual godsend to anyone who was ever frustrated trying to find out about a
 band like ruins the book is an encyclopedic reference with an extensive
 alphabetical listing of hundreds of fringe japanese bandsartists featuring
 full discographies essays on various subscenes and even an appendix with
 label addresses and contact info and best of all its in english unlike the
 first frenchonly edition ill let you find it on your own and you will if
 this is your bag but for now lets talk about the most important stuff the
 music
 the cd features tracks from 18 of the most important contributors to japans
 independent music scene it covers a lot of ground conceptually speaking
 modernclassical avantprog idm neotrad japanese folk noise punk
 basically anything john zorn has been preaching since he started his
 intercontinental commute in the 80s its a much more varied collection than
 others such as bad sun rising or tokyo flashback and perhaps most
 comparable to the excellent doubledisc virgin uk release cosmic kurushi
 monsters tokyo invasion vol 1 from 1996 this stuff goes out on a limb
 and be forewarned that a little artistic levity is required before entering
 standout tracks for me include gajis trippin under a changin sphere and
 hoppy kamiyamas fantasm b gaji is an experimental punk band from tokyo
 who actually started out as kind of an eclectic mix of wire krautrock and
 boredoms but here sound much more focused and traditionally wound the bands
 female vocalist hasegawa yuko reminds me of a less girly patty donahue but
 the bands sound here is fullon aggressive totally assured polypunk think
 minutemen crossed with 80s king crimson too many reference points how about
 moving on to kamiyama and about a dozen more
 hoppy kamiyamas tune is a great representation of many of his favorite musical
 outlets bartokinfluenced chamber classical horror soundtracks rock in
 opposition and no wave the guy has seemingly been around forever and covers
 a lot of bases in his 4xbd minutes on this cd if you never have the fortune of
 hearing some of his work youll probably run into him indirectly when
 investigating the scene anyway because hes head of the excellent god mountain
 label pugs koenjihyakkei optical8 demi semi quaver as well as producer
 for dozens of acts elsewhere hes also worked with zorn and maceo parker in
 the west so i wouldnt try to hide from him
 electronic music gets its props here too as tracks by wono satoru yuko
 nexus6 furudate tetsuo and nakamura toshimaru demonstrate that not all of
 the best new computergenerated madness is coming out of chicago or germany
 nakamuras track is straight sinewavey stuff produced entirely from a mixing
 board with no inputs satorus allego was done using only a phonograph plexus
 while yuko nexus6s minimalist nskk sounds as if created more from the
 muse of a computer scientist than an experimental turntable magician lest
 these descriptions sound a bit technical furudates piece brings in a little
 royal courtyard sturmunddrang to spice up its strains of pounding sheet metal
 and reverberated signal beacons i suppose some of this stuff would work well
 in a mad max movie but im just using it to get pumped about going back
 to work tomorrow
 there are some big names here as well like ruins keiji haino and acid mothers
 temple but i dont want to bore you with the music the good fork has been
 possibly overhyping these last few months or it could be that i just dont
 want to go on like a crazed fan forcing this stuff down your throat instead
 heres something i read from an interview with avanthero oshima dan i think
 that japanese indie music is based on absolutely absurd spirit i mean its
 built on nothing it contains no culture on the one hand i think dan
 undersells the impact this music has on its audience because i can tell you
 firsthand that whatever the music is built on is certainly weightier than most
 anything else ive heard however he has a point this is music that is not of
 a culture but rather appears to be creating one whatever scenes you subscribe
 to ask yourself how many of them could remain as vital when even the chance to
 hear the music was an obstacle how many could overcome littletono
 documentation or familiarity with the principal actors involved right now i
 can only think of one and if you blink you could miss itthe first aphex twin track i ever loved was flim from the come to daddy
 ep theres not much to it some onehanded piano a single synthesizer swell
 and programmed drums the spare beauty of the piano melody is certainly to be
 admired its one of many aphex tracks inspired by satie but the real kicker
 for me has always been the beats flim looms large in my personal listening
 history because its the first track i remember hearing where the percussion
 carries the bulk of the emotional content its drums are loaded with tension
 constantly feeling as though they might be moving just a bit too fast for the
 tune in danger of falling over themselves but they never lose their footing
 and continue to drop into place with precision providing serious catharsis at
 the end of every 16th bar
 
 ive come across music where the feelings hinge on the percussion since i first
 discovered flim but ive not heard a band pursue the notion as relentlessly
 over the course of an album as bostons the grace period dynasty is an
 album of subtle touches and rare warmth filled with interesting melodic
 fragments and memorable sounds but the drums are what make these songs special
 just as alan sutherland of land of the loops used live bass to provide both the
 foundation and sonic signature for his work grace period mainman and former
 pitchfork writer chris otts drums are the heart and soul of this
 record
 
 paris au printemps begins the album with a sexy bit of french dialog and then
 one spoken line is plucked and set into looping motion the drumming on the track
 is loose and relaxed like its guiding the listener slowly into a dream a
 feeling enhanced by the velvety synthesizer chords thick round keyboard drones
 are a recurring theme throughout dynasty serving as a blurry pastel
 background for the brush strokes of the percussion best of boston begins with
 some of the warmest such drones on the record which are in contrast to the crisp
 cymbal hits that set the track in motion my girlfriend is one of the few
 songs to plainly incorporate an outside sample looping a section of a wordless
 threenote falsetto vocal and burying it beneath determined drumming and a looped
 acoustic guitar pattern all to sublime effect the militaristic rudiments that
 make up the rhythm of et in arcadia ego compliment the coldest synths on
 dynasty providing some interesting contrast to the generally congenial
 tone
 
 occasionally the grace periods experiments with drum texture dont quite hit
 as on the bombastic bonhamisms that encompass the annoying boring arial
 layout but these occasional misfires arent what keep me from loving this
 album dynasty comes up a bit short for me in its overreliance on the
 looped fragment as a basis for composition these songs are evocative
 wellcrafted and emotional but some of them are also too repetitive a quality
 with potential to limit repeat playability in the distant future
 
 for the time being though i am digging this record its fair to lump the
 grace period with sampledriven outfits on labels like slabco or my pal god but
 the similarity is primarily in the mode of production theres nothing even
 remotely kitschy about dynasty you never get the feeling that somebody
 spent 500 hours in front of the television flipping channels with one hand with
 a finger on the vcrs record button the grace period is softer more reflective
 and ultimately more human what voice samples there are might be recordings of
 friends who happened to be hanging around instead of a pop culture travelogue
 the grace period feels more like a diary one openended enough to apply to
 anybodymy badass hypothesis one ive staked much of my musical career on is that
 lastname bandnaming is the secret formula for instant success and
 stardom the proof speaks for itself winger nelson bonham dokken danzig
 and dio to name only a few for over 20 years i counted on my last name
 haywood as my ticket to celebrity
 
 that is until a group of bastards from brooklyn decided to lift my birthright
 the righteous moniker of my forthcoming avantmetal band haywood my band would
 have featured me brad haywood on vocals and autoharp along with my sister
 kelly on bass flute and my dad chopping wood i was also toying with a way to
 work some midgets into the equation with my mother as coordinator awesome
 
 but alas twas not to be ive known it since 2000 when my friend bradly
 with no e how weird is that my friend is a fucking adverb picked up a
 copy of haywoods second lp men called him mister from a dcarea
 bargain bin i listened expecting little but the more i heard the more i knew
 my dream was not only in hot water it was plainly a bad idea it was best to
 leave the haywood legacy to men who although not haywoods by birth were
 haywoods at heart or at least had talent
 
 unfortunately for the world the haywood legacy consists of only three lps the
 latest of those we are amateurs you and i was released in late 2001
 after the band split to pursue other projects its an excellent work of catchy
 indiepop reminiscent of built to spill with a profoundly personal and
 sentimental side
 
 button up buttercup is so good it almost burns itself onto your next cd mix
 the tune employs three or four hypermelodic guitar hooks the best of which
 oscillates with a stiff drumbeat to lead stunningly into the chorus it would
 find itself subject to the rarely used repeat function on your disc player if
 it werent for its followup six stars a simple sentimental love crush i
 adore just your gorgeous eyes delivered with passionate blurryeyed
 authenticity
 
 competing with button up buttercup for tophonors on the disc is dont go
 breaking my heart which takes a heartfelt turn with groupsung vocals
 these are contrasted with percussive instrumental bridges the last slowing to
 a nearcomplete halt before firing back into a final powerchorus and
 instrumental section in less capable hands it might be boring but haywoods
 musicianship and maturity make it a powerful thing
we are amateurs you and i boasts the talent and focus of a band thats
 played together for nine years the final document sounds like both a personal
 diary and a thankyou note a last shot from a band in their prime they have
 done my family name proud memories of the elementary school perils of my
 surname prompt me to ask one final question hey would you guys come backits funny to hear people ranting about how the strokes ripped off lou reeds
 vocal affectations how they bite the velvet undergrounds style and how
 horribly inauthentic the whole thing is maybe its because the strokes only
 seem to have one influence dont bother the pomo collage known as influences
 on the friendly amg cheatsheet by the way but anyone with a cool uncle or
 anything beyond a radioland interest in music has listened to the velvets
 many many people have attempted to imitate them before and many more will do
 it in the future its a moot point
 
 the still dont sound like the velvet underground well kind of they have
 the garagechic veneer the occasional calelike passages of pure sound and the
 melancholy sneers of a conflicted songwriter its a comparison that gets tossed
 around from time to time and one that should come as no surprise to bandmembers
 alex hacker doug bailey and greg pavlovcak even if its not 100 accurate
 
 but lets do a little background work after hackers departure from the ropers
 in 1996 the onceslumberland darlings released an album with drummer mike
 donovan and then promptly disbanded the still is basically a reformation of
 the ropers and it follows the letter of the day its more mature and colored
 and its songwriting is less willfully pop than before theyve even signed to
 a new label trevor hollands pulcec
nectar is the first result of the ropers maturation and it takes every
 opportunity to genuflect to the bands various influences which draw primarily
 from wistful shoegazer and shameless mid90s britpop the opener sunshine
 is a reluctant seagull only doug baileys vocals crackle above a shoddy mix
 of echo and the bunnymen strings and descending basslines his voice is
 singularly unfit for the largeness of the mix though amy domingues theoretically
 doubles the lower frequency output on cello bailey always comes off weak and
 without inflection
 
 further play only proves this point as a dominant issue as borderline badass
 guitar lines like the one on wavelength are castrated by baileys
 shyguyturnedrockstar act this kind of posturing might be fine for the
 scratch vocals and okay for rehearsals but its unforgivable in the studio and
 an act of treason live lets hope bailey takes a few shots of his namesake
 before going under the lights that might be a good show
 
 whats sad is that most of these songs are great but overshadowed by blatant
 flaws the exception is ready now a track which simply begs to give the
 strokes a run the extra ten seconds spent on production and songwriting really
 here show through uplifting the already delicious pop goodness the spacemen
 3ish melody and sentiments of turned around however arent so lucky while
 potentially expansive they unfortunately surrender to mediocrity with rushed
 phrasing keys pushed too far back and endless distortion which strip the song
 of its poignancy all this of course points to trevor holland whose lofi
 aesthetics work for bands whose main strengths are unity and the desire to do
 things a bit dirty the still though dont need to fit the mold of modern
 primitivism as their vu view came through an english mirror a lovely pastoral
 megamultitrack recording would serve them where their current makeup doesnt
 
 the problem is the still are too caught up in idolworship with their eyes on the
 highest indie pop prize strokesification their songwriting instrumental
 bravado and dreams far outmatch their production and singer the future will
 hold one or more of the following a bailey will get the balls to finally front
 the band b the still will hire a new singer or c the band will take a ripened
 less reactionary stance and enjoy a renewed opportunity for bailey to set the
 vocals right or of course they may just go down as another unrecognized band
 who kinda sounds like the velvet underground if that turns out to be the case
 next pleaseas i type this numbfingered from the deskside window draught in my inefficient
 overpriced yet aesthetically pleasing apartment i must fess up to my undeniable
 attraction to the charming unnecessary and impractical im a form over
 function kinda girl all the way around so whats a subzero temperature and
 frequently compromised plumbing in an apartment where the moldings and doorframes
 are really cool right
 
 well in terms of being aesthetically pleasing the charm factor on sub pops
 new kinks tribute album give the people what we want hits just
 slightly higher than a sub pop promotional compilation kinks covers have lost
 a lot of their appeal since people started covering come dancing like it was
 going out of style dont do it for the love of god if youre in a band
 dont i cannot stress this enough
 
 whats great about this tribute though is that it effectively merges all of
 the above into a somewhat uninspired though truly weird amalgamation that
 eviscerates the competition by providing you with what you never even thought
 about wanting for instance a quiet heartfelt rendition of waterloo sunset
 as performed by the fastbacks its the most charmlessly charming utterly
 superfluous album ive heard in a while and to get right to the point if you
 consistently answer the question do you really need that with a resounding
 yes consider this compilation a possibility if not you should probably
 skip the rest of this review and pay your phone bill
 
 now that ive isolated the spendthrifts please understand that im not making
 an argument for this records kitsch value that would be something different
 something less premeditated and probably less bizarre but where most tribute
 albums suffer from a hyperobsession with remaining true to the original artist
 this compilation makes a strong case for the offbeat some portion of this could
 be attributable to the featured artists i mean when you think murder city
 devils the kinks arent exactly next in line for free association but this
 is a good thing im all for the eclectic
 
 still that well over half of the artists on this album have at least semiformal
 connections to sub pop makes the record resemble someones creative idea for a
 promotional sampler hey people really like the kinks this might in a
 roundabout way sell more murder city devils records on paper it looks like
 a good idea one can imagine a postit on a desk in a certain seattle office
 reading dont forget the punk rock cover of come dancing the kids love
 those
 
 however under careful scrutiny the notion sort of deconstructs itself sure
 the kinks are great but that doesnt change the fact that the murder city
 devils take on alcohol done up in the old killdozer style is mostly
 unappetizing both mudhoney and love as laughter contribute tracks both sound
 like an afterthought with mudhoney one expects a certain amount of laziness
 but love as laughters tin soldier man recorded by only half of the band
 is a real disappointment after the great sea to shining sea
 
 in fact some of the better moments on give the people what we want are
 either foregone conclusions or way out in left field for example garagerockers
 the fallouts offer a perfectly credible version of the man he weeps tonight
 conversely the makers compelling strangers comes off a bit like the bastard
 child of neil diamond and iggy pop uh its really much much better than that
 sounds elsewhere the posies jon auer and singersongwriter heather duby
 contribute mellow adultalternative covers of fancy and the way love used to
 be and nikol kollars rb rendition of i go to sleep is remarkable only for
 her uncanny and i do mean uncanny vocal similarity to fiona apple
 
 to say that give the people what we want is predominated by filler
 wouldnt be completely fair some of the filler isnt bad just predictable
 the young fresh fellows the congratulators and of course the artists shied
 away from the obvious no one covers lola without completely avoiding the
 predictable pratfalls the punk rock version of come dancing by a band called
 the briefs who tragically didnt get my memo on not doing that
 
 hmmm so hey are you sure you really need that
 
 your callits been over three years since 4 hero released their last album two pages
 which has given them enough time to hobknob about the industry and pool together
 enough guest musicians for their latest effort creating patterns a kind
 of chicken soup for the soul for those that gotta get their minds together
 apparently feeling pentin by their simple designation as drumnbass luminaries
 dego and marc mac have decided to spread their ambitions far and wide creating
 an album that harkens back to stevie wonders songs in the key of life
 and herbie hancocks head hunters
 4 hero are obviously wizards in the studio the production values and sounds
 they create are sterling however the topical concerns of creating patterns
 bring to mind an incredible array of isms eastern mysticism religious
 syncretism and socially progressive getyerassoffthecouch pragmatism to
 name a few that come close to derailing the musical content with nearly 30
 years separating us from songs in the key of life the conceits contained
 there simply sound nave here they border more on the selfindulgent
 my interest in creating patterns was largely piqued by the uk hype
 surrounding its release and its designation in more than one place as
 albumoftheyear i was prepared to follow suit 30 seconds into the first
 track conceptions when i was taken aback by the gorgeous mix of layered
 strings sitar and soprano sax over a loping bassline that wafted from the
 speakers like a shower of perfumed lotus petals i eased back in my chair and
 let myself float away prepared never to come back except possibly as a
 bodhisattva gushing praise for my new favorite album but what followed was
 a letdown aside from conceptions theres really only one other track on
 the album that took me hook line and sinker les fleur and even this song
 lost most of its luster when it revealed itself as a nearly notefornote
 replica of minnie ripertons gorgeous song of the same name
 my experience with creating patterns was consistently disrupted by lyrical
 contributions i found hard to swallow time features the ubiquitous ursula
 rucker spoiling a perfectly good arrangement with her openmicnight voyage of
 spiritual conflict which is only enlightening insofar as it displays how much
 more convenient it is for a poet to ransack the old testament than to try to say
 something original
 mark murphys performance on twelve tribes is far more convincing and i loved
 his delivery but it also includes lines like twelve the infinite number
 all of us are twelve once and then never the same twelve opens the eyes and the
 mind we learn more between the ages of twelve and eighteen than we ever again
 experience in learning the mayan calendar ends in 2012 what then hmm hmm
 i assume were supposed to find this incredibly mindblowing maybe after
 smoking a few bowls 2012 dude what a bummer wed better have this all
 smoked by then we dont want it to go to waste if you can ignore the
 silliness though its a great track that rivals medeski martin and woods
 whatever happened to gus
 another day features jill scott and its kind of odd hearing a woman that
 sounds like anita baker sing about how although shed rather stay home and play
 video games than go to work by god shes going to push forward and make
 something of herself unique turns things around with braziliantinged
 instrumentation and portuguese vocals and the day of the greys an epic
 folkinflected number keeps the record riding at a passable level hold it
 down might even appeal to fans of lauryn hill and straight ahead rb but then
 there are the numerous unpleasant excursions into jazz fusion like twothesme
 golden solitude and eight which grind away repetitively to the point of a
 mindnumbing nextsongplease anxiety
creating patterns left me disappointed and feeling that the album could
 have amounted to much more a shame because 4 hero are creating some of the
 most startling studio sounds ive come across the string arrangements that back
 the tracks here remind me of the golden age of 70s soul smooth and wellcrafted
 the beats are crisp and catchy and the scope of the album is ambitious even
 though in the end that ambition proves to be its biggest weakness ill be
 looking forward to their next effort hoping they decide to trust their own
 talents and go it alonemost kids go through some kind of music education in school probably in
 elementary school as secondary schools usually dont have the time or resources
 to force every kid to partake in music each year what usually happens is that
 kids will go through some kind of general music class wherein they learn to
 sing kumbaya in solfege or organize a performance of jingle bell rock on
 recorders and triangles for the pta meeting and people wonder why arts programs
 are increasingly being cut from public school curriculum
 
 there are a number of theorists out there with interesting ideas about how we
 should be teaching our kids about music german composer carl orff had an
 interesting idea about education since the beginning of time children have
 not liked to study they would much rather play and if you have their interests
 at heart you will let them learn while they play most of you probably had
 some kind of music ed experience think about it and consider if it seemed
 based on anything close to a concept of play i remember a lot of being forced
 to sing freres jacques and i can hardly blame the kids who knew it wasnt cool
 to do that stuff it wasnt and i doubt anyone teacher included got anything
 important out of that stuff
 
 in 1976 canadian music teacher hans fenger was inspired by orffs concept and
 decided to commence on a project involving students from several elementary
 schools in the provincial langley region british columbia by his own admission
 fenger knew little about teaching music to children but trusted the kids grasp
 of what they liked enough to arrange this project chiefly this project
 involved recording a group of students in a school gym on twotrack performing
 their favorite tunes and playing instruments developed by orff for use in his
 schulwerk program the recordings were never supposed to be widely distributed
 until producerauthor irwin chusid songs in the key of z heard them
 and the decision was made to make them available worldwide so in the end a
 completely local unpolished music education project is now at the fingertips of
 serious music fans everywhere strike one up for canadian taxpayers
 
 of course if you were skeptical that the results could match the inspired
 enthusiasm i wouldnt blame you the thing is these people put so much joy
 and interest trust me having interested kids is never a given for teachers
 into the proceedings that they make this cd good by sheer force of will the
 opener paul mccartneys venus and marsrock show captures the ridiculous
 amount of feeling for which the kids have for this music and they sound good
 too
 
 good vibrations features bells and acoustic guitar standards in orffs program
 and adds a little authenticity to the mix by bringing in the sleigh bells like
 brian used to do the singing and arrangement are actually a tad on the
 melancholy side much more restrained and poignant than youd think a group of
 grammar schoolers would be capable of in fact throughout the album the
 prevailing mood is often quite somber perhaps as fenger postulates the
 students loved songs that evoked loneliness and sadness or perhaps they just
 felt so at ease playing music that they couldnt be bothered with being hyper
 and unfocused
 
 david bowies space oddity is one of many highlights here as again the kids
 have the downtrodden verse melody mastered and even coordinate the countdown
 with some pounding percussion plus someone in there is dropping some serious
 spookorgan and another kid is going crazy on the special effects guitar its
 an amazing track followed by another the long and winding road now i dont
 really even like this song it may be one of the worst songs the beatles ever
 recorded however the langley schools arrangement for solo vocal one of a few
 on the cd and humble piano accompaniment brings out what was apparently actual
 inherent sincerity in the tune
 
 the record isnt an all lowkey affair later the kids bring out the noise in
 the bay city rollers saturday night with stomping and cheerleader chanting
 that only fifth graders can make legitimate which begs the question of how grown
 men ever performed this song they pull out the same stops on herman hermits
 im into something good to similar effect and begging the same question
 
 my favorites though are their versions of desperado and the carpenters
 calling occupants of interplanetary craft the former is another incredible
 solo vocal version of a tune that i always thought was extremely cornball i
 would go so far as to say that this version of the song with a young singer
 performing with so much heartfelt delicate emotion i seriously almost cried
 is definitive the latter begins as yet another solo vocal though the full
 choir joins in quite soon along with bells and swelling cymbals and bells
 youd think they were really announcing the next wave of civilization saying
 goodbye to the modern world in favor of something less imageconscious and much
 more honest and plain fun they even changed tempos in the middle
 
 now in all honesty a whole record of kids albeit inspired singing your 70s
 am gold hits has a greaterthanzero potential of getting a little stale after a
 while theres a wonderful feeling listening to this record that all will be
 well with our world and that as long as the children are happy and singing we
 have nothing to worry about but after a while if i need to put on some acdc
 or something i hope they dont take it personallytechhouse dub artist alex kruger is getting his share of attention despite
 his confusing tendency to record under countless radareluding aliases for his
 two fulllength 2001 excursions kruger selected his dub taylor mask and
 attempted to grab some of the glory surrounding minimal maestro matthias
 schaffhauser detect krugerastaylors second fulllength in 2001 is
 more of a compilation than forms and figures the other 2001 album kruger
 released for raummusik
 
 because of the speed at which kruger creates his tracks detect doesnt
 sound like a fitsandstarts hodgepodge of an assembly but it doesnt sound
 like a winner either when compared to other similarly inflected artists the
 music taylor rolls out is commonplace and merely functional the title track
 for example is merely a serviceable and crunchy rendition of the glitchdub
 house thats characterized the chain reaction label for the last five years
 yes krugers concession to innovation is restricted to a punchy bassline and
 slightly clickhopderived percussion
 
 sweet lips is the first vocal cut on detect and like the albums other
 four singsongs it suffers from a want of melody vocal house cuts by my
 reckoning should be hummable euphoria and sweet lips while vaguely
 memorable is hampered by a clumsy lyric about wanting your sweet lips on mine
 in a club setting and after five pints of lager such things might not bother
 me but at home i get to choose the music and it wouldnt hurt this songs
 rotation to be a little more interesting observer is a tougher version of
 the opener and sounds as though a tribally elated danny tenaglia or sleazy
 funked richard morel had embraced the whitenoise dub of berlin
 
 newman sinks the listener deep beneath an ocean of echoes where lee perry
 trades rhythmic jabs with moritz von oswalds rhythm and sound project with
 vocals by per fourier something somewhere and our youth launch you back to
 bassbinserrating techhouse john wayne is not an homage to the duke that i
 had expected unless wayne was really a khole queen who loved to squirm his
 buttcheekexposing leatherchaps into the nether regions of dancers around him
 
 i cant you know is the closest kruger has had to a recognizable club tune
 he combines his wooferworrying basslines with delicate fender rhodes noodling
 fourier unmemorably joins in with a lyric about not being able to fall in love
 with anyone but some darkeyed temptress whos made off with his heart id love
 to hear a vocalless version as kruger uncuts fouriers blankly delivered vocals
 with what sounds like a battling eric dolphy bass clarinet then detect
 concludes with 2scale in which kruger returns to his roots with the kind of
 echoing dub space thats influenced so much of european techno for years as
 such the record adds little new to the style but hardly disgraces it eitherdavid axelrod is an odd character in popular music theres really no bin to
 file him in though hes had his paws in just about everything thats happened
 in popular music since his career began way back in the 1950s in certain
 respects he fits rather nicely next to other idiosyncratic figures of his
 heyday guys like van dyke parks and lee hazlewood who kept up appearances by
 writing pop songs and producing other peoples albums all the while compiling
 their own personal back catalogs of bizarre often unclassifiable music
 
 however his music sits in a different realm more removed from traditional
 concepts of songwriting and instrumentation and vastly more indebted to jazz
 this makes sense as axelrod served as producer to such notables as cannonball
 adderley and stan kenton hes also responsible for much of lou rawls mid60s
 output and the architect of the electric prunes ultrastrange psychedelic
 mass in f minor if you own anything by dj shadow kid koala or any
 number of other modern turntable collagists chances are youve heard at least
 a few snippets of axelrods own solo work he even has a remixing credit himself
 on unkles rabbit in your headlights single
 
 his twelfth solo effort is a strange concoction of old and new that begs the
 listener to question when exactly it was recorded this is partly because it
 was actually recorded in two completely different eras the majority of the
 basic rhythm tracks for seven of the nine songs included here were recorded
 thirty years ago for an aborted project for warner brothers axelrod had
 actually completed the charts decades ago but it wasnt until mowax became
 interested in the project at the close of the last century that any initiative
 was undertaken to finish the recordings
 
 the thirtyyearold acetates blend surprisingly well with the new sessions so
 well in fact that its basically impossible to tell whats new and whats old
 the things we know are new are the first and last tracks the albums only vocal
 songs david axelrod opens with cold quivering strings strangely juxtaposed
 with james hugharts fretless bass leads what this gives way to however is
 much stranger
 
 saxophones and bassoon creep into the mix providing a strange menacing undertow
 that sounds nearly medieval in character deepening the mood is a choir that
 sounds more like a group of untrained people singing in a church than a tight
 professional ensemble the choir exits for the entrance of west coast rapper
 ras kass who plows through some impressive verses of beatless orchestral hiphop
 before lanny morgans jazzy alto sax solo seizes the spotlight kass returns
 stronger than ever in morgans wake though spouting lines like and your
 judges will all have work and your lawyers will flap their tongues and all
 your jail guards and cops will be the fathers to your young he laughingly
 tosses off the final line auction off your future
 
 this startling beginning is a pretty good indicator of what the rest of the
 record sounds like over the course of its toobrief 35 minute span jimmy
 t begins with howard roberts freakish guitar lead before slipping into some
 sort of quasisoul groove provided by la studio legends carol kaye bass
 lou morell guitar and earl palmer drums bob efford offers an impressive
 baritone sax solo and if you were curious joe samples the guy at the organ
 dissonant strings cut like shards through the bottom of the mix and the overall
 result is unlike anything ive ever heard
 
 crystal ball follows with a somewhat more identifiable phil spector vibe but
 that doesnt fully explain what it sounds like strings flutter in the wings
 horns blare in from every direction the guitars sound like they wandered away
 from a james brown album and the bass almost sounds lifted from pet
 sounds
 
 this leaves us with the singularly pretty fantasy for ralph ernie watts
 soprano sax solo is so unaffected and unpretentious that it ends up conveying
 a beauty very much unlike what we conventionally think of as pretty in modern
 music the flutes and other window dressing that introduce the track somehow
 manage to transcend the schmaltzy connotation that such an arrangement would
 usually have and the overall effect is far more current sounding than it
 probably should be
 
 the dr and the diamond and big b plus continue down this same richly
 textured and wildly eccentric path with the latter sounding something like a
 cross between a parade a string quartet and a hive of bees flutes flutter
 constantly on the edges of the song giving the proceedings a frenzied nervous
 feel as the drums and horns clamor away underneath only to have the whole
 affair interrupted by melting cellos and violins for lands sake travels
 to a southern revival for a bit of gospel albeit gospel polluted by any number
 of other bastard elements that are awfully difficult to pin down then comes
 the moody the shadow knows an oddly hiphopish track remember those drums
 were recorded thirty years ago laced with traces of peter thomas space patrol
 scores and endowed with more of howard roberts utterly bizarre guitar leads
 
 david axelrod closes on a powerful note with loved boy dedicated to his
 deceased son terry lou rawls infuses the simple lyrics with an intense passion
 that almost makes it sound as though its his own son that was lost oscar
 brashears clarion trumpet lines do their best to hold rawls together with their
 conversational tones but he owns the song seemingly dragging the arrangement
 along with him as though it were the very burden of grief the orchestra sounds
 broken chugging along with a sense of duty to the recording but never slipping
 into gear the result is so devastatingly sad and desolate that its difficult
 to imagine a weirder or more appropriate homage to a departed loved one
 
 david axelrod has created an utterly unique recording with his twelfth album
 one that sounds neither dated nor of its time rather it exists in that world
 of albums that really have no time albums like scott walkers tilt or
 joni mitchells mingus it even comes with unique packaging strangely
 wrapped in a cardboard slip case and inner artwork that resembles a little
 starship its hard to say who exactly would like this album but its nearly
 impossible for me not to recommend it if you have a taste for something new
 and a desire to hear an album whose effect will likely never be approximated
 anywhere else i urge you to give this one a spinnostalgias a bummer sappy longing for what once was and pathetic cries in the
 face of temporality to reverse its unending drive forward all end up a complete
 waste wasnt it the great oprah winfrey that assisted millions of bourgeois
 housewives all over america to stop living in the past perhaps we should
 transfer such poppsychology to our own indie living
 
 but i just cant get past the fact that this cherubino records gotten me all
 nostalgic the selfstarter foundation prides itself in releasing the debut
 albums by karate and les savy fav and now bringing us the debut sevensong ep
 from nycbased emo trio cherubino thats right the emo never dies just like
 the past i would say
 
 you see cherubinos raw rock elements and lighthearted melodies have me all
 distraught over the death of pavement and that zany malkmus the times when
 weezer werent so damn terrible and the fact that the electrified wails of
 the white stripes arent in my stereo at the moment of course i could always
 change the disc and relive those pinkerton years in a second but its
 just not the same
 
 and its not that cherubino sounds anything like any of the aforementioned bands
 only that certain elements spark that sort of nostalgia in me the quasilofi
 rock isnt totally lofi a la early pavement though the vague malkmusinflected
 lyrics do aspire to that level of brilliance without quite making it the
 guitar solo of mercury retrograde screams blue album weezer with its
 simplistic melodic sensibility soaked in overdrive lines like we could build a
 house just for two from the same track and the vocal turns in rocket are
 delivered with an almost passionate disregard by frontman travis peterson that
 sounds like a subdued jack white drummer karen tercho even chimes in for a
 vocal cameo on the latter in addition to her bangin beats
 
 but one must understand the divergence between these modern legends and cherubino
 for one the lyrics are concerned with little other than failing relationships
 its gonna take more than a kiss to make up for this sings peterson over the
 heavy shuffle of the opening track kiss the lyric is intoned with a
 playfulness that transcends the lines superficial banality primarily because
 of its implications and just like it takes some talent to even draw comparison
 to those greats cherubino rises above the general fodder of their contemporaries
 to create something that hints at potential
 
 hints of synth peek through the mix on a few tracks and like the brilliant
 breaking of the film strip incorporated into ingmar bergmans persona
 the sound disintegrates in the middle of car wreck their live performances
 are known for their inebriated energy but like former foundationeers les savy
 fav the sheer romp of this energy is lost in the studio what bothers me most
 is that even birds twentyfive minutes feel a bit indulgent unlike les
 savy fav cherubino has yet to stretch their genres stodgy boundaries of
 course this is only their first release so we can hope for the best in their
 future but for now im going to go curl up in the corner with my wowee zoweeif the early 90s was the era of the breeders just pretend okay the early
 00s just might be the era of the brooders the brooders led by an exciting cast
 of unmanly oversensitive introspective introverts make music that is often
 euphemized as sadrock or slowcore even the euphemisms are negative this should
 tell you something
 
 it just so happens that badman recording company has devoted its label to giving
 the suicidal among us a public forum job requirements at badman are minimal a
 guitar a voice and a prozac prescription talent scouting involves rubber
 gloves a good eye and a psychiatrists dumpster all the hard work has come
 with mixed success scoring badman some winners eg hayden some mostofthetime
 winners eg mark kozelek and now a guy who could use a little boost
 counseling maybe
 
 the man of whom i speak is named brian dunn dunn fronts a fivepiece ensemble
 known as the clairvoyants who presumably gain strength from being by themselves
 yet spend much of that time lamenting their own solitude dunns songs are slow
 and monotonous dominated by several elements the most notable of which is
 nothing in particular it makes you wonder what the other four people were doing
 and as for the monotony im curious as to which mnemonic dunn uses to keep the
 songs separate in his head
 
 besides for the plethora of nothing dunns voice occupies a decent amount of the
 foreground its a familiar one a gaunt meatless blend of nick drake chris
 isaak and brave sir robins lead minstrel now imagine compiling the orchestration
 of the first two and subtracting three out of every four notes and you have
 roughly the clairvoyants aroused maybe if youre a sloth
 
 a big part of it lacking emotional power is the ohsobad lyrics oh they are so
 bad in surface of the water for example dunn whines that you need me to
 keep you from harming yourself i know its futile i know its futile he
 enunciates futile with the anal precision of james lipton it comes out as the
 perfectly pronounced compound of its components few and tile with loads
 of emphasis on the tile part
 
 under a microscope the clairvoyants might make you wretch however if you do as
 i did and take a few steps back concentrate on the super bowl cook some dinner
 im your exgirlfriend your new boundaries makes for decent background
 music the tones of dunns voice combined with his tasteful backing band are
 mellow somber and wellproduced but you can answer this question as well as
 i is your record collection lacking decent background music is this a gap you
 need to fill do you really need stuff that absolutely refuses to grab your
 attention wouldnt your money be better spent on one of badmans good
 releases the answers are likely no no no and yes a wise move would be to
 set your new boundaries just short of the clairvoyantshere i am at the bottom again thanks to ryans system of review placement the
 lower the rating the lower down you go i always seem to occupy the nether
 regions of the review column which begs the question am i getting all the
 shitty releases or am i just that hard to please
 
 it used to be different it was more of an arbitrary editorial decision and
 i lobbied for a return to that system earlier today jefe i said you
 should really push this melochrome review up into the featured spot give me
 uh i mean them some exposure some hype
 
 yeah whatd you rate it
 
 uh so how about those bears
 
 where to begin oh hell lets just dive in the songs dont take shape rather
 they lose shape unraveling along the way they go from a sketch to a blank
 page from a metal frame to a pile of windblown rust the persistent problem
 is long length with no real development or point the songs try to build up
 in delicate layers with all the chance of a souffle at ohare even melochromes
 sole halfhearted attempt at rockingout summer jens feels miserably out of
 place
 
 the successful exception is the instrumental centerpiece the sevenminute
 aqueduct which mixes some mildly interesting twofingered guitar work with
 foundsound and a songlong shimmer this type of gentle meandering
 instrumental immediately recalls the six parts sevens work and not only
 because of the ebow also the closer boyfriend has some piano and
 violin interplay to make up for its undeveloped melody and dirgelike
 progression but that about sums up the good
 
 a compact example of one of stay a little longers more grand flaws can
 be found on the third track the years go by begins innocently enough a
 pleasing mix of strummed changes and keyboard diddling going handinhand through
 commonplace chord progressions with the first couple tracks singer prammod
 tummala had already established that his soft nasal singing is strained at best
 and seizureinducing at worst so thats not really a surprise here but then
 the boygirl vocaltrading comes in
 
 personally i found bassist darlene poole to possess one of the most distasteful
 voices ive ever heard she sounds like joey lauren adams on sudafed now
 plenty of folks love ms adams and think her voice is just fine even sexy
 thats great they would probably dig darlene too however i dont associate
 with that kind of folk because im just that kind of guy
 
 so thats what really did in half of the album for me just as kevin costner
 can ruin what would be an otherwise perfectly fine hollywood movie merely by
 being cast in it pooles singing is the death knell for stay a little
 longer a horrible offkey piercing knell i cant help but think that
 if there had been exciting challenging music to counterbalance this effect
 the whole affair wouldnt have gone down like a whore named titanicoaklandbased rappers the coup are about as adamantly political as hiphop comes
 the original cover art for party music planned long before the events of
 september 11th and originally intended to go to press on that fateful day
 featured an image of the twin towers exploding with the two rappers posturing
 in front of them one holding conductors batons the other holding a detonator
 the image says the duo was intended as a metaphor for the effect music can have
 on a corrupt system 75 ark said no a last minute phonecall stopped the presses
 and the cover was redesigned still no doubt the coup will go down in history
 as a strange footnote to a tragic day the unfortunate timing of the album cover
 remembered long after the music and thats too bad because boots riley and
 pam the funkstress deserve to be remembered for their music you see the coup
 knows the secret to effective politicization before you can change peoples
 minds you have to engage them
 
 like public enemy and george orwell before them the coup focuses on the art
 not the politics trusting that if they do one right the other will follow suit
 the result is music that questions the common presumption that all things
 political must also be dry and boring for one the coups is a sound drenched
 in rb and soul tradition holding more in common with outkasts raucous
 funkdriven beats than it does with similarly minded rap groups like cannibal ox
 as such the coup are likely to reach an audience less accustomed to these types
 of ideas
 
 wrapping their political missives in twisted slithering rhymes like this is my
 resume slashresignation a ransom note with proposed legislation riley and
 pam prove that the music is every bit as important as the politics in 50
 million ways to kill a ceo the coup demonstrates a wickedly dark comic
 sensibility taking the cartoonish tendency towards violence often prevalent in
 popular rap music and applying it to an uncharacteristic victim among their
 suggestions toss a dollar in the river and when he jump in if you find he
 can swim put lead boots on him and do it again you and a friend videotape
 and the party dont end tell him that boogers be sellin like crack he gon
 put the little baggies in his nose and suffocate like that put a fifty in the
 barrel of a gun when he try to suck it out aha well you know this one
 
 for the less murderinclined riley and pam offer a few slightly less radical
 solutions to societal problems simple things like rebelling against unjust
 authority or merely choosing a stance take a look around and be for or
 against but you cant do shit if you ridin the fence but things really hit
 their stride on get up where guest mcs sticman and m1 from dead prez intone
 its a war goin on the ghetto is a cage they only give you two choices be a
 rebel or a slave while a group of female vocalists sing an atypical mantra in
 typical rb backup singer style youre sposed to be fed up right now turn the
 system upside down
 
 the coup cater masterfully to a wide audience always holding fast to their values
 only once do they stray too far in their attempt for a broad listenership heven
 tonite is the requisite sensitive rap song and while the lyrics are stronger
 than most in this maligned subgenre any sentiment is negated by the swisscheese
 guitars lifted right off a smooth jazz station party music doesnt quite
 pick itself up in the two songs that follow but by this point it doesnt much
 matter theyve already proven themselves worthy and a few weak songs do not a
 weak album make
 
 theres been a tendency since the world trade center attacks to keep talk of
 political dissent to a minimum in the meantime our leaders have continued to
 act in their own best interests using the current wave of patriotism as
 permission to hold open the federal wallet to corporations cut funding to
 important programs and refuse to sign the international nuclear arms treaty
 meanwhile the press reports littletonone of this fearing the possible
 consequences in times like these groups like the coup become that much more
 important party music is an effort both entertaining and politically
 motivating a feat which many have attempted but few have successfully pulled
 off perhaps its radical message will succeed where other dissidents have failed
 in galvanizing those whove become disenchanted with our fearless leadership of
 late and in introducing a few others to the healthy practice of skepticismscreenwriting guru robert mckee once joked that the shortest book possible would
 be a history of german humor he said this i believe without having read a
 single interview with markus popp the dour german stereotype may be common for
 people in the states raised on sprockets but its just not accurate exhibit
 a flanger
 
 look at the front of this record cover atom heart and burnt friedman standing
 on the barren surface of some distant planet in full astronaut gear only its
 not really them just some cropped press photos of their faces pasted into jpegs
 pulled from the nasa site they look so damn goofy standing there on that
 planet but theyre clearly in on the fun and then there are longwinded the
 liner notes written by a fellow named james dean brown which claim the only
 way of downscaling burnts musicalconviction potentiometer is to previously
 install a logical bypass
 
 on second thought mr dean brown could be on to something a potentiometer is
 an instrument for analyzing electrical potential and outer spaceinner space
 is vastly superior to last years midnight sound because it contains so
 much more possibility both records are basically light cocktail jazz
 manipulated via computer but where the source of midnight sounds crackly
 raw material seemed nebulous outer spaceinner space is a crisp recording
 of live musicians who put some energy in their playing hearing this more
 natural approach bumping against the electronics gives the record a great deal
 more tension than the sleepy midnight sound could muster it also makes
 the listening more fun
 
 the third track the men who fell from earth is a nice illustration of what
 im talking about the opening section blends percussive static hits with
 manipulated drum runs of inhuman tempo and then the piece abruptly transforms
 into lazy downtempo lounge for a couple of minutes before accelerating once
 again into spastic glitch music each individual part is rendered properly but
 youd never imagined that they could fit together so well or indeed that they
 could fit together at all lo dernier combat is another track that seamlessly
 modulates from medeski martin and woodstyle instrumental jazz to abstract
 electronics and back again the skill here is in the transitions not only are
 they not jarring but each stylistic shift seems perfectly logical odd guitar
 treatments crop up here and there courtesy of enigmatic cologne musician josef
 suchy lending another intriguing texture
 
 the tracks that fall outside the conceptual framework still impress with their
 melodic sense and rhythmic interplay though the album was no doubt edited on
 computer and its quite possible that none of the musicians actually performed
 together the notes list separate recording studios for each of the
 instruments the infectiousness of the latin beats is undeniable and the three
 chilean percussionists credited help give the record an impressive syncopated
 pulse inner spacesuit in particular absolutely bubbles with rhythm and it
 always makes me wish i had a drink of some kind in my hand when i hear it but
 this straightup track has a surprising coda as the rhythm fades and suchys
 processed guitar harmonics take over sending the piece spinning off in a
 completely different but equally attractive direction both funny haha and
 funny strange outer spaceinner space is worth exploringa party is no place for introspection yet when im thrown into an environment
 surrounded by people most of whom dont know me i tend to find a quiet corner
 sure a party is supposed to be a social gathering but for whatever
 reason i just cant help being lulled into a space where only i exist
 thankfully chad crouch and the crew over at portland oregons hush records
 have made available a series of records under the antirock banner lacking
 ambition or exuberance hush records are perhaps the most conducive records
 available for those inappropriately introspective moments and bobby birdmans
 debut is no exception
 bobby birdman is rob kieswetters stage name and even sounds like a 1960s
 throwback sort of pseudonym which happens to perfectly reflect birdmans music
 singing of love ominousness and being cold let me in reminds one of
 the microphones phil elvrum was he to lose his analog fixation and begin toying
 with a powerbook but in traditional hush form these electronics are about as
 subtle as bjrks swan dress remaining calm and atmospheric accompanied by
 simple drum machine loops a lulling strummed acoustic guitar and these
 inorganic treatments birdmans voice resembles a tired stephen merritt trading
 in the throaty tenor for a smoothly delivered wispy croon
 i must admit that i love you opens the record gently with a manipulated cymbal
 fadein which is overtaken by a primitive drum machine line resembling one of
 those credit card metronomes that were used in my middle school orchestra class
 not that this comes across as silly but the aura of let me in resounds of
 little ambition and even less groundbreaking a bassy drone complements birdmans
 voice as he moans the albums eponymous line the melody is sweet and nostalgic
 and remains as such throughout the rest of the record
 moving onup and its instrumental counterpart paradise dub are based upon
 decelerated drum loops an acoustic guitar lazily strums a single chord in time
 with the percussion with leads the way for elvrumesque vocal ahhs in harmony
 moving melds into paradise which plays the loop offset with a very subtle
 reference to the chord progression of the previous track
 golden arms follows an almost a cappella number backed by light backwards
 guitar lines the lyrics once again draw a line to elvrum i walked up the
 hill into the dark out of my body i moved undetected j tear begins with a
 gratuitous three minutes of birdman repeatedly counting out waltztime with some
 echo manipulations before fading into another mellow acoustic guitar number
 hey now is a gorgeously simple song enshrouded in vocal harmonies calming
 down to such an icy feeling another quasia cappella track in which the
 voice clicks from slight electronic manipulation while quiet drones hum in
 the background
 the record reaches a poppy apex with blue skies complete with acoustic drums
 other peoples voices and a singalong chorus therell be blue skies nothing
 but blue skies yet it never broaches the inyourface border and collapses
 into a loopedvocal coda after which birdman breathes his last moan with the
 closer perfect for light on the whole let me in may bore some with
 its lack of motivation and the seeming absence of passion but to me it seems
 like let me in was created for my wrongplace wrongtime introspectionas a zappa album title once asked does humor belong in music
 
 well yes and no it all depends on artist or album it seems like one of the
 hardest things for musicians to accomplish is to write songs that are both
 genuinely funny and musically valid something more than just novelties zappa
 did it on a few occasions but then again if you release dozens upon dozens of
 albums youre bound to have a few successes and then theres ween and the
 dead milkmen both of which frequently pulled off the balancing act
 
 on the other hand there are bands like barenaked ladies who try to impress with
 a constant stream of pop culture references and end up with unforgivably annoying
 fratboy singalongs and ben folds who halfassed his way through both his
 serious and funny songs undercutting them both
 
 of all the recent attempts to tread this fine line between quality and humor
 parker paul does it better than almost anyone a former member of the
 charlottesville virginiabased band the curious digit which also featured adam
 busch currently of manishevitz wingfoot is pauls second solo disc
 piano and other assorted keyboards remain the musical fulcrum here as they
 were on his debut lemonlime room but paul has rounded out his sound on
 wingfoot with help from a host of luminaries from the chicago music scene
 like jeb bishop vandermark 5 fred lonbergholm wil hendricks the aforementioned
 adam busch and songs ohia guitarist dan sullivan and as a bonus the whole
 deal was committed to tape by michael krassner of the lofty pillars and boxhead
 ensemble
 
 on the surface parker paul strongly recalls ben folds if only because all his
 songs are pianobased but a better comparison might be randy newman or to go
 outside the realm of music woody allen his songs like allens best films use
 humor to explore themes of existential dread and anxiety but whereas allens
 tone is neurotic and selfdeprecating pauls is bemused and detached
 
 on wingfoot nowhere is this better exemplified than with when i got you
 at the pound preaching salvation by means of a pet dog and remember dog
 spelled backwards is god paul sings to this canine messiah after seeing a
 show on pet therapy for the elderly last night i dreamt of heaven all of our
 names on your collar the song also features the best lyrics about sifting
 through dog vomit that i know of night crawlers and blades of grass shifting
 continents in egg yolk lincolns profile in the morass
 
 elsewhere paul tackles the human condition with pain pain pain pain pain
 take a guess what its about where he reveals catholics propose pain is the
 path we all should have chose but the unitarians are much more interested in
 fun yet what saves this song is from being a simple joke is the same thing
 that saves paul from being a simple novelty the little lyrical profundities he
 tosses in the middle of everything like on pain which ends with the lines
 hold something in your hand set it down say a prayer walk away written
 here it doesnt seem like much but in the context of the song it makes all
 the sense in the world clicking like a zen koan in the mind if youre
 paying attention most of the songs on wingfoot have these little lyrical
 nuggets but if youre not careful theyll float right by like marshall mcluhans
 cameo in annie halli walked up to the local community college on a whim it seemed decades since
 i first realized that any prospective goals i had could only be achieved through
 a commitment to academia but for years id lacked the vigor to take any steps
 toward realizing my potential so as i entered the admittance office i
 bore a sense of pride that had been all but foreign to me since high school
 after the necessary paperwork had been filled out i was presented with a number
 of options for possible courses only two piqued my interest one cryptically
 titled cultural literacy and criticism the other called nathaniel merriweathers
 deconstruction of the modern eros i had no idea what cultural literacy could
 possibly mean and having gone to public school i decided it was probably
 instituted for aspiring writers so under the impression that id have more
 opportunities to utilize my talents as a writer than as a lovemaker i opted for
 cultural literacy and criticism
 
 initially i was plagued with regret it had come to my attention that mr
 merriweather was to have a very strange assortment of characters guest lecture
 before his class and the resident prelector of cultural literacy one dr nayr
 rebierhcs was hardly concerned with churning out the next shakespeare for the
 first few days of the course i was completely in the dark as to what he hoped
 to achieve by talking about the science of wit litmus tests for cultural
 relevancy and the tragic dictatorship of mediainduced opinion but eventually
 things began to fall into perspective on one particularly enlightening occasion
 dr rebierhcs was instructing the class on effective literary devices
 
 we shall begin he said in his usual didactic bravado with the most primitive
 device a critic must keep in his canon the analogy well start with a very
 simple example and then move onto more esoteric selections darren aronofskys
 pi is to independent cinema as will cullen harts circulatory system is
 to independent music the class reacted to this with varying degrees of
 inquisition but eventually came to the consensus that the statement was
 plausible the doctors eyes scoured the room finally settling on mine
 
 mr adickes can you give us an example of analogy
 
 i struggled for a few moments and then thought of mr merriweather and his motley
 crew of sexperts i stammered out mike patton is to sex as abe vigoda is
 to sex
lovage meets every expectation one would have for an allstar lineup
 had their preconceptions of an allstar group been defined in the 80s with the
 release of bandaids do they know its christmas or was heal the world
 the prototype dan the automator followed when assembling the likes of prince
 paul kid koala plug 3 of de la soul jennifer charles of elysian fields
 and mike patton to create a selfparodying album about doing the dirty
 regardless of where the formula originated someone needs to crack a window
 cause its gone bad
 
 the album begins modestly enough with an endorsement from prince paul the
 automators partnerinmediocrity from handsome boy modeling school this sets
 the tone and incidentally the tempo for the remainder of the record as
 flourishes of mandolins and a sampled brass section segue into pit stop take
 me home the albums thematic developments come to a jarring halt thanks solely
 to the absolutely wretched lyrical content all but one song was written by dan
 the automator aka nathaniel merriweather jennifer charles and mike patton
 and each sounds like something a cocktail waitress would find scrawled on a
 napkin freshly slipped to her by a roaming businessman i think a pussys your
 best bet stroke that shiny coat stroking is the antidote stroke that its a
 start only for the wild heart ive listened to this album ten times straight
 and the genius of these lyrics which find jennifer charles graphically
 chronicling a menage a trois has managed to elude me
 
 the music is infinitely more tolerable though it occasionally becomes as garish
 as the albums art which is horrible even by the lenient standards of kitsch
 here are some basic musical ingredients which if all mixed together would give
 you a fair idea of the automators musical approximation of lovemaking

 
 now that doesnt bode very well does it the negativity doesnt end there im
 afraid my biggest gripe about lovage is that it finds a number of
 clearly talented artists constructing the same song continually without variation
 kid koala for one lays down some nice turntable work but is never allowed to
 exercise his full potential if the mood strikes you songs like sex im a
 and strangers on a train can be mildly affecting but the sensuousness of many
 of these tracks relies solely on charles heavy breathing and husky voice and
 somewhere around the ironically titled love that lovage baby the potency of
 her moans begins to wear off which is why none of this makes any sense if
 theres anything nathaniel merriweather hates its impotencethroughout his career with low alan sparhawks commitment to brooding slowcore
 has been unparalleled his newest lp the debut from his blues trio the
 blackeyed snakes displays his brooding versatility here he exchanges the
 romantic wistful and clearly caucasian tones of the slowcore indiebrood for
 the coarse soulful brood of the blues
 
 although not nearly a blues pioneer sparhawk along with drummer brad nelson
 and guitarist bobby olson displays a studied faithfulness to the genre for the
 most part the sound is vintage electric chicago blues employing a raw
 twoguitar attack that buzzes with the dirty sound of overworked amps and blown
 speakers to give the reptiles some balls sparhawks ordinarily sweet
 reflective vocals are made crude by innumerable filters and feedback
 
 the snakes songs range from traditional to unconventional on the traditional
 side the album opens with two footstomping guitar duels chicken bone george
 which could pass for the work of another george thorogood and smokestack
 lightnin a cover of the classic howlin wolf tune willie dixons legacy is
 preserved later in the album with a limp cover of his chicago blues staple
 mannish boy replete with screaming teenagers and poorly executed lyrical
 riffing and new orleans is the bands finest blues original built around a
 laggard guitar riff and wailing harmonica
 
 less conventional are the neoblues manipulation of mobys bessie smith sample
 honey a bluespostpunk hybrid cover of the falls my new house and a
 snakes original big black train the frontporch rhythm section and twangy
 guitar on honey is likely to funkup even the most ardent moby haters my new
 house is anomalously ambitious playing with contemporary effects and production
 before dropping back into a traditional overdriven blues jam big black train
 uses songstructure familiar to low but with more sonic power a fourchord
 progression intensity built around simple shifting dynamic elements like
 tempo and volume and repetitive singlestanza lyrics
 
 but conceptually the snakes could use a hand sparhawk pulls a chris gaines
 with the project adopting a moderately retarded selfcreated alterego named
 chicken bone george my understanding has always been that bluesmen earn their
 nicknames either by genetic defect or tragedy of misadventure whatever
 sparhawks reasons be it to help him remain in character or simply as
 novelty it doesnt do much for the authenticity of the product everyone who
 will buy this album knows who george really is and knows that hes been party
 to lyrics as sappy as i held your last breath in my hand i held your last
 word in my heart not exactly the pained expressions of a motherless
 devilpledged outlaw
 
 sparhawk could especially do without some of the more contrived extensions of
 the persona for example his bluesman posturing is both illconceived and
 poorly executed as on 8inch knife where george delivers an unnerving
 exhortation for spouses to kill their philandering husbands with oversized
 cookware sparhawks goofy bluesman voice sounds like a bad elvis impression
 and the content is plainly silly unfortunately sparhawks failure to sell
 chicken bone george is persistently distracting he would have been better to
 keep his own name and forget the act
 
 when an artist engages in music appreciation as the blackeyed snakes have with
 the blues theres always the question of what makes the update worth buying in
 this case the answer isnt obvious the majority of the effort is straight
 traditional blues without any indie flair or flavor to it apart from sparhawks
 indiecred it can be pretty entertaining if youre in the right mindset but
 its nothing muddy waters elmore james willie dixon or robert johnson havent
 already done and done betteremo screamo dont listen to them the shit is metal whats worse
 its metal that denies you that payoff that comes with a corny bloodyfingered
 guitar solo you can direct your frustration and derisive laughter at in fact
 theres not much to laugh about here at all unless boring trebly palmmuted
 guitar riffs and really really bad emo screaming are particularly funny to you
 
 the obligatory anasarca was a dcarea five piece that recorded very little in
 their threeyear existence yet somehow managed to earn themselves a substantial
 fanbase and subsequent influential status and influential they are the music
 on this sevensong retrospective will definitely influence me to drop their cd
 into the garbage incinerator chute on my next trip to the elevator
 
 in discussing why it is i despise anasarca there are two main issues that
 merit attention the music and the singing to their credit guitarists chris
 afzal and carl riddle and even the rhythm section of bassist jim sajor and
 drummer mike weltz churn out standard sometimes even kinda pretty metalcore
 background music the kind that could get you hopping around and pumping your
 fist if you were into baseball caps nogirlsallowedtype shows in small
 sweaty venues and being an angry waspy teen not to their credit on
 the other hand is nick pimentels hellishly silly voice which lets the steam
 out of the other four guys boring but at least thoughtout musical
 arrangements
 
 remember cobra commander from the gi joe cartoons hint he was the one
 with no face screeching like his voicebox was on fire you might have assumed
 that all this time he was living off the residuals from his glory days or
 maybe you thought hed fallen through the social service cracks and resorted
 to squeegeeing motorists windshields for spare change at a random innercity
 intersection anything is possible but we know for sure what he was doing from
 19941997 he was nick pimentel frontman for anasarca granted his abrasive
 idontdonotesstyle singing has since 1997 become an established vocal
 genre of its own but i personally see no reason to explore the roots of this
 fine tradition
 
 to the songs then east bunk hill and eugene debs are the first and second
 tracks but are so similar that well just speak of them as one stopstartstop
 aaaaiiighhhhyyyyeeeee stopstartstop grgrgrgreeeeeeee the guitars
 drop out then the bass plays some noncommittal but vaguely ominous part for a
 few bars aaaahhhhhhkkkkghhh
 
 things get appreciably better on track three everything was beautiful and
 nothing hurt though maybe a couple things werent awful but the vocals
 still hurt would have been a more honest song title this song as distinct
 from its two predecessors actually makes use of melody it even sports a clever
 building intro lively drumming and a twovocal part
 
 track four stationary people also flirts with singability in a fairly
 pleasant manner you almost wonder if theres more to anasarca than
 their halfhour discography suggests which isnt to say the track is great
 it sounds sort of like the demon from the exorcist covering an offspring
 song but whatever shit looks tall when youre in a crater this deep
 
 enginize starts off positively wussy was anasarca having a rough day we
 dont know but in any case the songs intro is the prettiest moment in the
 bands whole history of course you can guess what comes next
 aaaaiiighhhhyyyyeeeee good youve been paying attention of the seven
 songs this track earns silver honors
 
 you know and so tell me finish things out in monotonously rockin fashion
 the former showing flashes of guitarplayer consciousness the latter earning
 the first place with its rare dynamism and the successful twovoice arrangement
 and then sweet silence if youre a fan of this genre save yourself the
 trouble of emailing me your thoughts add another bunch of points to the
 rating and enjoy if youre not just remember cobra commando knowing my
 friends is half the battlein the spirit of full disclosure i should start off by saying red shirt brigade
 are pitchfork advertisers keeping us staffers in turtlenecks and knickers
 well into the new year but this palmgreasing in no way affected my estimation
 of home of the cannon saints and i can with a clear conscience say
 that this is the best album of all time and red shirt brigade are better than
 the beatles hell theyre even better than badfinger
okay boys hows that for quotes for your press kit on a completely
 unrelated note i accept paypal and credit cards payment through billpoint just
 so you know
 
 all sarcasm aside this actually is a pretty damn good album not groundbreaking
 or revolutionary but intelligent full of hooks cheesy yet fun keyboards and
 a lot of energy that manages to steer clear of angst or emoboy whining its
 the kind of solid album you listen to on a cold winters day and easily get lost
 in its bright unaffected exuberance and forget about your worries for awhile
 
 death cab for cuties chris walla produced cannon saints which goes a long
 way toward describing red shirt brigades sound they display the same kind of
 smart melodicism and rhythmic variety that keeps things consistently interesting
 even though theyre operating within a relatively narrow framework that is
 punkish poprock played on bass drums guitar and keyboards
home of the cannon saints starts off with a minutelong drone before the
 first proper song thugs with venom which is albums best track tempo
 changes flow gracefully from one to the next and bright angular guitar lines
 are balanced with genuine fistpumping moments of distortion and riffage its
 accessible without being watered down or simple in a kinder world it might
 even make commercial radio
 
 but cannon saints doesnt blow its wad right away there are other
 pleasures to be had here the very next track later on in the whole word
 with its waltzing rhythm somehow brings both nirvana and wings to mind in the
 same way that dismemberment plan sounds like both genesis and james brown
 likewise years of skulls sounds like an imagined dave brubeck foray into
 modern rock with morrissey at the mic very precise almost cold but infectious
 its melody setting up shop in your brain and staying there
 
 dismemberment plan offers a good overall point of comparison to red shirt
 brigades sound the young band obviously took notes while listening to
 emergency i expounding on the feel of the plans masterpiece and
 capturing a lot of its energy without sounding too derivative but while the
 dismemberment plan is fronted by one of the most charismatic and creative
 singers in the biz red shirt brigade lack a similar strong confident leading
 personality as yet but then again on the dismemberment plans debut disc
 travis morrison hadnt really found his voice yet either and thats the
 feeling cannon saints leaves you with a lot of potential but just not
 quite there yetas each day passes it becomes more and more difficult to write a truly gratifying
 pop song part of the pop equation relies on a sense of spontaneity that has
 become increasingly elusive as listeners have now had debatably seventyfive
 years to construct an emotional immunity to the same unvarying formula there
 are always those who will invert the standard for successful songwriting leaving
 the accessibility to the less daring then there are those who acknowledge the
 inescapable grasp and scope of their musical heritage and imbue their own music
 with enough inventiveness to endure repeated discriminating listens
 
 unfortunately many seemingly creative bands merely stumble upon whatever unique
 sonic deviations earmark their respective sound and once they have it patented
 infuse it with every damn beatleschuck berry regurgitation they write so it
 should be said that while an original technique is an occasional indicator of
 true talent ie phil elvrum and his affinity for rightleft channel panning
 guitars true judgment should be reserved for the frequency in which you actually
 listen to the artists recorded output this is the best way to delineate between
 talent and plain sticktuitiveness so what do you do with all those outstanding
 songs mired in between albumfiller and the token ballad attempt you make a mix
 tape
 
 orion walker expresses his love of mix tapes in the liner notes of the soundtrack
 to his film dean quixote theres a lot of great music being made but
 youll never hear this music unless you look for it or unless youre lucky
 enough to have a friend that makes you a mix tape indeed orion walker seems
 to be a man of sagelike advice and the psychedelic murmuring of his mix tape
 to us his audience only reinforces the notion that hes a thinking mans man
 and his taste is nigh impeccable
 
 the album commences with the olivia tremor controls jumping fences which
 after nearly five years still evokes the same paradoxical euphoric dystopia as
 it did on dusk at cubist castle there is no conceptual analysis of
 the modern pop song to be found as on black foliage just will cullen
 hart and bill doss stretching their comparative musical muscles and setting the
 ambience for the vast majority of the record
 
 elephant six dignitary robert schneider seems to pop up randomly throughout the
 course of the album his band the apples in stereo are well represented with
 the inclusion of what happened then from the hitandmiss discovery of a
 world inside the moone and his orchestre fantastique offer up the films
 theme stars on the sea all said orchestre fantastique sounds like
 incidental music for 70s educational programming but within the context of the
 album its breeziness is easily overlooked especially when compared to the
 beachwood sparks this is what it feels like alt version both of these
 tracks which would normally undergo a far more jaded critical knife actually
 provide a fair definition for the album a group of artists offering their
 winning interpretations of the archetypal pop song
 
 the minders turn out a piece thats not entirely dissimilar from what nick drakes
 instrumental bryter layter would sound like if interpreted as elevator music
 and spink whose name should really be changed if they wish to gain an ounce of
 respect cover the palace brothers classic new partner elsewhere songs ohia
 stay around just long enough to infect your blood with the catchyasallhell
 hot black silk though it may be impossible for jason molina to escape the
 will oldham comparisons he shows here that he has the range musically and
 vocally to transcend a few of those stylistic similarities
 
 the remainder of the album is similarly engaging robert pollard who is
 supposedly close friends with walker appears in the film and donates the
 underrated gem if we wait from the generous tensong sunfish holy breakfast
 ep and like such revivalist luminaries as goldfrapp and the squirrel nut
 zippers in their more sultry moments crystal keith and kim fox come to the
 radical conclusion that the seduction of lounge music didnt die in the 40s
 with their contribution o what a noble mind is here overthrown
 
 im glad to say that i havent seen dean quixote hearing these songs free
 of their intended context seems to have nourished the area of my brain that would
 have been deprived of stimulation had i watched this film at the local art house
 so im taking the purists route the visualizations ive conjured up are more
 fantastic than anything that can be committed to celluloid life just cant be
 contained in 24framesasecond and rather than have the film inspire the
 soundtrack ive allowed the music to catalyze my generally dormant creativity
 the only flaw in my plan my expectations for the actual film have far exceeded
 the very constraints of cinema this soundtrack has ruined it all for mein the new issue of chunklet comedianangry guy lewis black discusses why
 his proposed sitcom never got off the ground the only thing that kept us off
 the air was that they wanted to do it with a laugh track and i wanted to do it
 with a live audience that was the only way they were going to sell me he says
 what would have happened was youd make that exchange the writing of that
 character becomes broader because im pushing the envelope to get laughs
 because instinctively i know how to work an audience i know where to go
 
 to some it might seem like black is being a little picky yet another victim of
 the agesold beggarscantbechoosers rhetoric but anyone whos ever stood
 before a crowd of onlookers be they eight or 800 and performed knows the
 difference an audience makes for many the audience is a terrifying factor one
 theyll do almost anything to avoid but for a select few the audience is as
 necessary to the creative process as watermelons and giant hammers are to
 gallagher to stick with the standup theme its the catalyst that kicks them
 into gear starts the adrenaline pumping and allows them to tell jokes play
 music dance act or do whatever it is they do on a level theyd be incapable
 of reaching otherwise
 
 bullfrog a canadian band gaining crazystyle exposure thanks to their turntablist
 eric kid koala san would seem to fit into this latter category ever since i
 came to the conclusion a while back that koala is gods gift to the turntable
 ive made a point of collecting recordings and catching him wherever i can and
 i must say that when it comes to live performance his band bullfrog puts on a
 hell of a show stepping up from their backing role on koalas carpal tunnel
 syndrome and generally holding their own
 
 bullfrogs music isnt anything stupendously original they function as a
 laidback combination of hiphop funk rb and phishy hippie music not
 unlike say g love and special sauce nor are their lyrics particularly
 demanding despite song titles like ya ya and ababa which might suggest
 otherwise and the content rarely elevates above standard partyrockin
 goodtimehavin fare by all logic bullfrog should suck royally but
 something about the live performance galvanizes the band live theyre on
 top of their game a great party band and ready to start the motors of even
 the most initially indifferent crowd
 
 but when it comes to recorded music well maybe bullfrog shouldve taken a
 cue from lewis black try though they might to capture the spirit of their live
 performances the generally lackluster nature of bullfrogs selftitled debut
 proves that the band just isnt the same without an audience to play to sure
 bullfrog has its moments slow down is nice enough teetering between a
 cappella 50spop and laidback reggaeinspired jamband fare bullfrog theme
 carries a certain confidence not present elsewhere in the album and kid koalas
 collage intermission extra track ii is a fun mockery of music industry politics
 unfortunately these are the exceptions not the rule though all six members of
 the group remain technically proficient or better they generally lack the energy
 and passion in a recording session that makes their live show so much fun
 
 one gets the feeling that someone at atlantic realized this at some point as
 presumably to capture some of the energy of the live show someone has taken
 the liberty of peppering this recipe with various clips from live performances
 however the recording quality of bullfrogs live content is to put it gently
 fucking terrible many of the live tracks stop or start at awkward moments in
 the middle of songs vocals echo across rooms much of the content sounds canned
 and muffled and koalas contributions are often mixed far too low making them
 impossible to hear over rollicking drums rather than adding spice to the flavor
 these tracks stand out like an ugly hair at the bottom of your soup
 
 ultimately this package reeks of having been thrown together on the run no
 doubt in an attempt to capitalize on koalas touringwithradiohead status
 before the yorke groupies forgot his name and while its tough to criticize a
 band for attempting to grab hold at whats likely their best bet for success
 its a damned shame it had to go like this they may not be the most amazing
 band in the world but bullfrog deserves better than this maybe the future will
 bring us a proper live album from this band but in the meantime potential
 listeners would be better suited holding their breath till the band rolls into
 townthe pitchfork holiday party was weird at least it wasnt held in the
 office but schreiber wouldnt pay for train fare and chicago was fucking
 freezing and i got so many dirty propositions that the walk felt like the senate
 antechamber i wasnt interested in martina and her package deal though
 so i ducked into the vfw hall all the new kids were gathered around the
 punchbowl making small talk and ladling nervously i circled the room
 browsing conversations richardsan was pitching the fork like a grizzled sea
 veteran with paul cooper nodding politely sage was pouring liberal amounts of
 scotch and buckman and leone were talking gibberish about yamatsuka and
 kawabata ethan p was up in john darks face about something but i didnt
 want to get involved someone was missing but i couldnt remember who
 
 the party improved after alcohol was drunk and avalanches were played fueled
 by some gin and too little tonic i started to wander turning the corner i
 came facetoface with some indie kid the cocked eyebrow baggy trousers and
 tongue poised to spit words like motorik marked him as from either the
 fakejazz or splendidezine conventions down the hall for sure but we passed
 with little more than the industry nod down in the next wing the strains of
 some sick sound caught my ears like a ghost bored into domestication the sign
 on the door said international association of muzak licensers and muzak
 engineers annual meeting i slipped inside and stood up against the wall
 
 are your clients tired of traditional muzak need a new way to capture your
 customers brand loyalty genx has been tuning out our messages for years it
 just isnt receptive to edutainment anymore but there is a solution la
 makita soma is muzak for the filtered generation designed specifically to rock
 out and yet keep the profits rolling on in i understand they call this
 postrock here in the windy city youve got jolly little keyboard melodies
 merry vibraphones humming in time and drum crashes in all the right places
 every sound is carefully leveled out in the production process leaving the
 results smooth and synthesized and darn if that guitar solo doesnt match the
 best muzak classics im hearing santanas everything is coming our way
 
 oh god it was awful kraftwerk posing as kinky robot fetishists was one thing
 but ive never heard a group of musicians so pleased to sound like a casio
 keyboard demo it was like theyd boiled instrumental rock down until anything
 remotely lively and threatening had evaporated and the distilled essence of
 suck just oozed out of the speakers like medicinal syrup the pseudopsychedelic
 jam on glossalalia at 47th made me wonder if id downed a valium the entire
 prozac nation might still be bored by this roofierock oh yeah and theres a
 sample of kids playing at the beginning of the title track kids playing i
 was just coming to understand the need for mood medication when i heard it
 dink dink dink
 
 thats right folks the makita five even comes up with a new musical genre
 we call it electroniska because it has the lilting upbeat of ska music
 thats a twelveminute song with enough wild solos and calm segments to satisfy
 consumers and investors alike after all theres nothing like a little reggae
 to spruce your step when youre lost in the supermarket eh get it
 
 the ska riffs stabbed into my mind on and on and on but they were far from
 halcyon the label reps kept referring to brighton park as techno but
 it sounded like the downfall of western civilization to me theyd used pedals
 as general anesthetic delay and reverb and wahwah all combining into a soupy
 mixture spilling out of the busted cornucopia of thirdrate tortoise bargain
 basement jams then a woman asked a question
 
 how will la makita soma affect the market in light of the new wave of recordings
 were nearly finished with the specials gangsters will the release of
 brighton park hurt our returnoninvestment for rat race
 
 the guy chuckled la makita soma cares about demographics maam thats why
 weve included a rapper on spaceship hifidel will broaden your outreach
 sector when he talks about reptiles armed with projectiles crisscross in the
 night sky like african textiles theres your urban and science fiction markets
 in one verse
 
 i spun and ran back to the welcoming arms of daft punk or whatever it was the
 staffers were playing brent sirota looked me right in the eyes and shook his
 head he knew and maybe orourke did too the new year didnt look so bright
 anymoreit pretty much goes without saying that a vocalist can make or break a band the wrong set of pipes can
 ruin a sound the right one can elevate the emotion of the music beyond any meaning in the lyrics it
 also goes without saying that there are plenty of people out there who cant really sing in what wed think
 of as a traditional sense carrying a tune seems simple enough but its remarkable to consider just how
 many voices out there arent built for it
 bevel is the solo project of drunks via nuon and lets just say that hes one of those millions of people
 who wasnt endowed with a naturally melodic larynx part of the problem seems to be in his delivery he
 doesnt project at all and notes can even get lost as he trails off on the other side of the coin though
 hes a fantastic guitarist and he can be mesmerizing when he wields his acoustic
 and so it follows that somehow nuons lackluster vocal performance doesnt really get in the way that much
 on his debut release as bevel hes composed 13 different paths down the folkways of america and the
 haunted nature of the music usually allows his sometimes downright antimelodic delivery to settle in and
 get the job done however awkwardly it certainly helps that hes joined by fifteen high caliber musicians
 from members of souled american lambchop and dirty three to chicago session players like fred
 lonbergholm jessica billey jason adiesewicz and michael krassner whove played on records ranging
 from pinetop seven to edith frost to wilco
 yet even with all that talent theres nothing flashy about where leaves block the sun instead it
 prefers to stay on the periphery decorating your atmosphere in much the same way that a real bevel might
 lend character to a piece of wooden furniture it opens with a gorgeous acoustic guitar instrumental called
 exitrance setting up the orange and brown autumnal theme of the music with its thoughtful melody and warm
 fingerpicking
 generosity is the first song to feature nuons voice as he tackles an oddly singsong melody as best he can
 over a textured background of vibes and guitar textural is the operative descriptor from here on out as
 virtually every song explores some variation on a basic acoustic musical texture by and large the days
 get a little shorter toward the middle of the album as the darkest textures are explored there icy pianos
 spread like frost around warmly bowed violins and steven dorockes steel guitar occasionally rises in the
 background like steam rising off a mug of cocoa
 while his singing may not be amazing nuon does manage some fine lyrical moments such as the line every
 engineer hates every other engineers work from the middle of the wasted liquid burns siberian
 sunrise lives up to its title with sprightly little guitar melodies trickling over a frozen droning
 tundra like the first rays stretching across a frigid wasteland and the instrumental theme for harold
 may as well be the siberian sunset as everything is plunged back into darkness and bitter cold
 perhaps the most unpretentiously beautiful moment on the album though is oklahoma a brief 1xbdminute
 interlude featuring nothing but michael krassners starkly recorded piano set alongside what sounds like a
 field recording of a supermarket parking lot its a truly transcendent moment that perfectly sets up the
 final track prologue of the recalcitrance here nuon offers a fractured verse over an improvised
 backing before simply turning the musicians loose ending the album on a chaotic yet consonant note
where leaves block the sun is an ephemeral pleasure much like walking beneath the changing foliage
 of fall and feeling those first few stiff cold breezes of the year bevel never strive to drive anything
 home instead offering it to you and letting you decide what you want to take with you and while thats
 appealing in its own way this is certainly not an album to throw on just any old time on certain occasions
 however it will work nicely at night especially when the leaves are turningin music there arent many things as dependable as your rock heroes inevitably churning out bullshit it
 happens to the best at some point or another maybe they rebound dylan costello maybe they dont
 mccartney prince but its telling that as listeners we often fall into the trap of treating our music
 like amusement park rides expecting bigger and better thrills with each passing year now im not arguing
 for constant entertainment a saturated experience that fills voids we didnt even know existed and despite
 the perennial letdowns i wouldnt expect these musicians to take critical reactions any more seriously than
 television static a million critics can be wrong just ask the next person who isnt fooled into
 believing prog is inherently bad quick theres another one but would it be too much to ask for a new
 wrinkle now and then
 guitarist robert fripp formed king crimson in 1969 with michael giles ian mcdonald and futuretotalembarrassment
 greg lake their debut record featuring brooding mellotron dark epic ballads and fripps signature
 brainiaclaser guitar lines especially on the classic raveup 21st century schizoid man helped define
 progressive rock in its earliest stages and is still held as one of the most important records of the genre
 today in the 70s the band worked through various lineups and eventually settled on a group featuring
 fripp exyes drummer bill bruford john wetton and david cross not the bald comic that band managed
 to almost singlehandedly defy all stereotypes thrown at prog not only by being one of its greatest proponents
 of free improvisation but also by just rocking the hell out of the worlds concert halls in the 80s fripp
 brought in guitaristvocalist adrian belew and turned the band into a tightly wound new wave machine
 imagine talking heads crossed with don cab and in the 90s the band mixed and matched all of these
 sounds pleasing pretty much their entire devoted fanbase until now
 you see the problem with happy with what you have to be happy with a compilation of new stuff
 studio pisstakes and one live track released to satiate the poorfans crave until next years fulllength
 isnt that king crimson have abandoned their sound or moved away from what made them so interesting but
 that its a culmination of the last few years stagnation from the frippertronics fripps patented
 ambient guitar technique to the eclectic percussion instrumental to the funny blues tune theres
 a notsothin film of decay drenching almost every moment on this set the two new ideas the first being
 the title tracks depressingly outoftouch stab at xfcmetal the second being the studio cutnpaste of
 einsteins relatives seem by turns desperate and unnecessary 2000s the construkction of light
 hinted at complacency but was at least energetic
 the title track is the worst offender on the record opting for hamfisted satire of bands that king crimson
 shouldnt even be aware of they toured with tool recently and i can only imagine the latenight hilarity
 on that tourbus at the great expense of the jam i have some words this is the way ill sing through a
 distortion box to make them menacing sings belew ha ha he sure did bite korn there next up king
 crimson exposes the idiocy of milli vanilli and 50s game shows belew throws in a few practice rounds on
 autoharmonizer just to show hes still got peter framptons number and potato pie is the embodiment of
 filler
 perhaps even more frustrating there are some okay songs too mie gakure may be oldhat ambience for
 fripp but its nice nonetheless belews eyes wide open proves that he is the worlds finest imitator
 of a david byrnejohn lennon hybrid mutant and that he can write a pleasant hook when called for even if
 the song does recall moments from just about every crimson record on which hes appeared but alas these
 are drops in an increasingly empty bucket better to burn out than fade away say it aint soout of this summers furnace their first album in five years oxbow apostles from that small seam of
 true gutwrenching horror oxbow who stink of phlegm and germs and unprotected sex oxbow whose live
 shows frighten even the few converts whove come to see hard music born of slow corruptive bile from
 deep down inside not the tantrums of chugging cheerleaders of doom theyll put the lie to your grindcore
 bands right quick
 
 with titles like king of the jews and the balls in the great meat grinder collection its not hard to
 fathom oxbows lack of fame but youd think the foursome would at least be known for their frontman if
 only for the hecklers hes beaten down in his day there are few spectacles like eugene robinson more
 than six feet of black muscle standing downstage thighs spread briefclad crotch thrusting forward eyes
 rolling in holy fervor the crowd steps back a few feet and eyes the exits
 
 the twotrack opener the snake the stick finds him perched in the pulpit more than ever before
 cursing shouting screaming from the background his cries come like those from the drunks you see
 stalking down the street lost in their own private stew of hate at the same time he whispers up
 close with allure one sunday morning the preacher went atrawling to the house of fuck he come
 acalling a raspy voice admits i got couch sluts of every stripe sir boys and girls and the
 inbetween types and right afterwards the band busts into an exaltation of sabbath riffage might as
 well strip your clothes off burn your preacher comics and bask in the squalor because garth ennis aint
 never going to come close to this freaky
 
 in times past oxbow sounded somewhat like labelmates neurosis or a spoiled birthday party an evil
 heat cools the fire just enough for a slower burn the main hooks of these songs seem bluesbased at
 least at the beginning as youre reeled in stallkicker opens with a rough blues crunch and the cymbal
 crashes resonate like electric shocks it even ends with a brief coda of almost pretty guitar picking
 but they return to their trademark queasiness a sidelong slither between noiserock and metal on s
 bar x on which former swan member jarboe guests her low moans circle his highpitched keens until it
 all mashes together in a swirl of seething feedback
 
 given all the old folktales of forks in the road and deals made at midnight the whiff of blues here makes
 sense scentwords seem to be the most appropriate theres an odor of pheromonal aggression thats just
 tangible on this record and it alternately sickens and succors rarely have i been so thoroughly seduced
 after an averse reaction and rarely have i been so driven to get up and thrash around and feel the blood
 pulse through my veins skin in particular grips me until im aware of the sad state of my own flesh
 what with the brutal whip of the snare and the tale of the cockhorse teeth like sugar cubes play the
 blues balls hanging between his between like crab apples hating his hide and hiding his hate
 potentate of the small and the great
 
 what wages do you earn after the sins of the first halfhour the other half a thirtytwo minute near
 instrumental by the name of shineglimmer it builds in buzzing bass drones and dives back down into
 distortion endlessly climaxing and clenching up and coming at you again its a primal jam fueled by
 pure carnal libido so get together with some inclined bodies and slap skin together an evil heat
 may not be for everyone but youre going to keep an open ear its been too long since youve listened to
 anything this hard so kneel yourself down now and look upwards at old eugene its time for your

 to play everything anyway i dont mean to say that the music is necessarily
 jumbled they generally avoid the postmodern pitfall of cramming a hundred ideas
 into one song instead this band takes a few dozen ideas catalogs them and
 creates lots of little postcards to paste into their album only the postcards
 are the songs except when theyre actually cards like the inserts that come
 with this album and the eclectic ideas seem either illsuited to the bands
 strengths hazy psychepop as far as i can tell or simply beyond the range of
 their abilities to pull off and while i admire any band willing to bring a
 little eclecticism to the mix what i hear as the failure to cover bases set
 forth in the music is a disappointment
katastrophe vol 3 is zmrzlinas third release i should give my respects
 to whoever designed the packaging because its rather amazing all futuristic
 artdeco and matte coloring and featuring the aforementioned card inserts this
 is a project i imagine as much thought went into as the actual recordings in
 fact i wonder how a band like this even has enough cash to create something like
 this as publishing houses and art directors dont often come cheaply design
 is credited to the group so perhaps somebody internal had access to a printing
 press and some serious adobe skills so in summary props to the designers
 as for the music well its nothing if not goodnatured yet its often
 amateurish where it should be accomplished rough where it should be smooth and
 goofy where it should be strange the first track supermarket radio begins
 promisingly enough with some eerie strings and a looped childlike vocal
 this is nice something of a cross between bernard herrmann and bjrk but the
 song doesnt actually begin until the band enters about a minute in
 disco drums and some wahwah guitar introduce the groove and then everyone
 drops a mad blondie beat so vocalist jeff ray can expound fred schneider style
 upon who knows what atrocities theres a running stringline throughout and
 the band occasionally returns to the opening neatness however i get the
 feeling that this is the kind of music that sounds better when you have a million
 bucks to fly a producer in from iceland to clean up your mix and get a decent
 drum sound what it could be highgloss transient artpop what it is flat
 aimless upstart pop
 elsewhere on schoolgirls drummervocalist heather snider lends a gentle airy
 lead to some fairly dull where they should be punchy strains the arrangement
 combines a terribly bouncy drum loop laidback guitar strumming and a whipping
 violin line thereby prompting me to play rockcritic and call this what
 folkpop means in the 21st century or possibly folktronica but that game
 sucks and in fact this tune just sounds unfocused ending with a long guitar
 solo that wouldnt have sounded out of place at lynyrd skynyrd show
 there are cool parts too creek lullaby gets the downhome groove right with
 some nice guitar picking and a relaxed beat even managing to throw in a
 disorienting vocal loop the song is perfect for a light buzz and it helps
 that the band doesnt stretch out this concept so long that i lose interest
 which they do quite often on the rest of the album kentucky which features
 more of the annoying talksinging from the first tune manages to be too long and
 yet not dull in the slightest i give credit to ralph carneys moaning woodwinds
 on loan from tom waits band and the fact that the stonesomber vibe i get
 from this tune suits zmrzlina to a tee im telling you if they put out an
 album of all psychedelic funeral marches id buy it and like it
 those are the high points on an album i would say is at least a few edits andor
 omissions shy of something consistently interesting its not that zmrzlina
 arent creative for all i know theyre all great artists on the verge of the
 next big movement in rock but there comes a time when your grasp has to keep
 up with your reach if you want to inspire of course this doesnt happen
 everyday for artists but when it does people take notice and new classics are
 born perhaps katastrophe vol 3 is just a stepping stone to future
 greatness or maybe just a misstep altogether everything theyre doing could
 be nice given different contexts but sometimes just everything isnt enoughits tough work being a jackofalltrades for onetimecarpenterturnedunofficialbeastie
 boy mark ramosnishita keeping up appearances alone is time consuming at best
 when not collaborating with the aforementioned superstars contributing his
 keyboarding aptitude to everyone from femi kuti and santana to mary lou lord
 money mark writes produces and plays almost every instrument for his own solo
 releases his albums are increasingly becoming stereo standards for the slick
 bars and slicker parties where the patrons and guests have better hair better
 credit and more impressive portfolios in every sense of the word than you do
 
 but dont hold that against him its not moneys fault the high dollar tapas
 bar down the street plays his discs on endless repeat if anything change is
 coming is a sort of musical guidebook for how to throw your own exclusive
 soiree in the privacy of your own home
 
 and no worries about the relative provincialism of your whereabouts information
 contraband the albums second track with its samba style beats swirling
 traffic simulating keyboards and ill communicationstyle downtown funk
 creates a big city feel perfect for that moment early in the party when all the
 guests have arrived had at least two cocktails a piece and have begun mingling
 loudly in your living room
 
 youll want your first course to be sweet and sour a conflicting yet pleasant
 taste to complement the airy spaceagemeetsmetalguitarsmeetssleazyfunk of
 glitch in da system dont worry about scaring off your guests the combination
 is unusual though mild enough to be palatable even in its moments of dissonance
 
 the high point of the evening comes with the main course another day to love
 you money mark would probably recommend something hot and spicy an excellent
 paella or some ingenious cuban concoction guaranteed to get the guests riled
 up perhaps for an impromptu dance halfway through the meal another day to love
 you sounds something like a 21st century revision on the buena vista social club
 complete with jazzy piano and intricate latin guitar the combination is a little
 sexy if at all possible season it with an aphrodisiac because things are gonna
 stay pretty steamy throughout the rest of the album
 
 even on the dance numbers peoples party red alert comes off like uptown
 disco despite its jazzy horns and squealing flute the crowd can migrate to the
 dancefloor to sweat off dinner before you serve dessert something with a tropical
 flavor is recommended to accompany the cruiseline muzak of use your head
 your guests are guaranteed to like it even if you integrate leftovers use
 your head originally appeared on the 1996 red hot compilation red
 hot and rio money mark understands a great party doesnt always necessitate
 completely original material
 
 bid farewell to your guests and get to work on those dishes with rain nyc
 the background recording of an actual rainshower will prove a soothing counterpart
 to your faucet the melody here bears a remarkable resemblance to a certain
 george gershwin penned standardlullaby especially when supplied by ulises
 bellas trillheavy clarinet so even after all the excitement of the evening
 falling asleep shouldnt be too much of a challenge
 
 a perfect party a perfect soundtrack to your perfect party youll sleep like a
 baby and inevitably wake to realize that change is coming doesnt play
 so well by the light of day stripped of its socialhour context it sounds
 like a kitschy ersatz reproduction of a beastie boys album without the vocals
 and a little too much like that cocktail nation disc you found in the
 used rack at your favorite record shop for 300 a couple years back you
 remember immediately why you bought that disc this is gonna be great at a
 party and why you never played it when do i have those kind of parties in
 fact do i even want to have those kind of parties and then you
 remember the novelty of marks keyboard repair you liked it you really
 did but this seems dull by comparison hopelessly tied to the role of background
 music and thats okay i mean everybody needs good even exceptionally good
 background music from time to time but is it really worth it to pay full price
 for this cd
 
 heres another drawback if youre not careful youll be expected to throw these
 parties again and again and again regardless of the rapidly depleting funds in
 your bank account and the mysterious curry dust that has seemed to permanently
 settled over your whole kitchen its a bitch being so multitalented an ideal
 host an excellent chef a friend to the stars a masterful party dj just ask
 money markjenny toomey indierock luminary that she is has come a long way as both artist
 and interlocutor since tsunamis final album 1997s a brilliant mistake
 she left her simple machines label to begin the future of music coalition
 putting herself in the precarious situation of being an devoted artist with no
 time for art somewhere in the midst of these four years was catastrophic love
 a heartbreak so tragic and special it warranted a doubledisc both her pedigree
 and tendency for advice date her these are not the tales of a wideeyed youth
 yet where time almost invariably wears on musicians leaving them without so
 much as a shred of inspiration or cultural relevance toomey has remarkably
 managed the unmanageable shes aged while maintaining her grace
antidotes 16 tracks range between bitter patsy cline to resigned
 when you get cold and borrow some of the best talent offered by the two
 cities each of these discs respectively represent chicago and nashville
 the chicago disc features not the first names that come to mind when you think
 of the city but arguably more interesting ones in these postpostrock days
 engineer and expulsars member david trumfio trip grey on drums supercellist
 amy domingues aluminum group frontman john navin drag city crooner edith frost
 and violinist andrew bird of bowl of fire fame nashville artists jean cook
 and lambchop member mark nevers who has also engineered albums for leann rimes
 and vic chesnutt fill out the lapsteel and slow carameldrip sadness of
 the nashville disc
 the nashville selections languish in the inflection of lost love long legatos
 brushes and sprinkles of piano color toomeys ruminations her voice recalling
 the punctuation of natalie merchant and the lilt of sam prekop full and strong
 without the sense of virtuosity that could ruin its context by the third track
 the smell of him toomey has proven the strength of her moodsetting the song
 oozes style with soft angles and upright bass the steelladen artful dodger
 takes the most chances of these songs toomeys vocals fall outside the beat
 her melody picked above the slow procession of chords its a strange vervelike
 moment of violin tremolo and stylized country made all the stranger by toomeys
 lyrics unrhymed articulate and serious
 the chicago disc packs up the sad strains and sends them off on defiant bursts
 of horn beating them with dance rhythms and washes of distortion it opens
 with patsy cline a tongueincheek advice column for ladies who love their
 premodern men clear cut takes the borderlineclich metaphor of doing away
 with love entirely and remodels it and breezewood pa pulls toomeys
 cynicism to the fore with the opening lines if i took advice from editors of
 certain teenage magazines that dictate style for teenage scenes and guidelines
 for romance id surely speak with more reserve on certain sparks all this in
 a showtunestyle bed whose nuances call to mind jim orourkes willfully
 commercial pop solo work
 this disc almost seems a response to a questioning of her musical intent she
 answers by allowing her crew to convert simply good songs into great ones the
 band employs their greatest tricks domingues crescendos which bend into
 subtly hooked guitar lines are particularly affecting and the engineers mix
 songs like charm city with sassy dropouts and explosive horn sections
 when toomey presented these new songs at ladyfest chicago she explained that
 they could all fit on one disc spacewise but really shouldnt be together
 stylistically at all dont think im ambitious because i took two though her
 songwriting remains characteristic the treatment given by each pack of musicians
 is worlds if only timezones apart if nashville breathes deeper than chicago
 its simply because toomeys strength is her weakness that her greatest lines
 arent windycity comebacks so much as those questioning the sincerity of love
 in the land of musicmost of us spend our lives sleepwalking through the daily
 routines and sometimes it takes the jaws of life to rip
 open the perceptive confines that coincide with a life of
 ritualism you awake one morning to the braying tone of your
 alarm clock and drowsily reach over to turn the damn thing
 off only to find that the established procedure for doing
 so causes no reaction you press the off button two or
 three more times to make sure you havent made an error in
 judgment as your senses become more acute and your emotions
 inflame something has usurped the authority of logic
 shattering your rationalizations of many wildly complex and
 confounding variables and schooling you in possibility
 
 explosions in the sky have elucidated these prevalent truths
 for me through their epic instrumental lamentations though
 the band are hardly the first iconoclasts of the revered
 versechorusverse formula theirs is a music of possibility
 like few others have dared to make on their debut album
 how strange innocence they brandished a sort of
 restraint that often teased listeners with visions of the
 groups capability were they only to let loose the
 bandname implies scorching collages of noise yet most of
 their crescendos end in plucked strings and comforting
 ambient gauze
 
 on their sophomore effort the contradictorily titled those
 who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall
 live forever the group has recanted on their more
 unexcitable tendencies opting to infuse their work with a
 formerly unseen rawness and intensity and even if its
 not a didactic analysis of what constitutes music such as
 the olivia tremor controls black foliage it
 certainly makes for a revelatory listen
 
 greet death opens the album innocuously enough with
 inaudible strumming that surfaces just long enough to be
 devastated by seething drums and scathing distorted guitars
 such previously foreign abrasiveness is an immediate indicator
 that explosions have rewritten their aesthetic principles
 while leaving their ability to wield a stark melody virtually
 unimpaired as the dust clears and the sonic damage is
 assessed the remaining feedback segues into a sober slide
 guitar denoting a major transition in the songs emotional
 appeal the track ends as a burgeoning riff of apocalyptic
 proportions is suddenly and unexpectedly smeared across the
 audio spectrum with digital effects
 
 these structural inversions are a primary signifier of those
 who tell the truths sound arrangements are introduced
 and then dismantled as though theyre vying with one another
 for the listeners attention mogwais young team
 is an obvious reference point both records feature similar
 instrumentation and softloud dynamics but where young
 team was content to methodically construct its walls of
 jarring white noise those who tell the truth builds
 more erratically and upon first listen illogically but
 with every subsequent listen the internal organization of
 each song becomes more inviting
 
 ambiguity seems to be one of the discs greater appeals
 depending upon your mood the album can document good versus
 evil existential insignificance versus blissful ignorance
 war versus peace or whatever other contrasting forces best
 suit your life at the moment where so many lyricists fail
 in exacting the perfect sentiment explosions in the sky have
 crafted a record comprised solely of everchanging blanks to
 be filled in and though each of these tracks supposedly
 tells stories one needs only draw upon their own life to
 understand the pathos explored may these songs become a
 soundtrack to your vanityit feels strange reviewing this ep now since i bought it on
 vinyl roughly a year ago at that time i thought it was the
 prerelease teaser for hoshi no koe featuring the
 catchy single sign along with an a capella version not
 available on the cd release another new track and a
 lengthy collaboration with some postrock guys from chicago
 but the cd release of the ep got pushed back presumably so
 that the bonus cdrom an animated video of sign by cover
 artist katsura moshino could be completed to make the cd
 more enticing thrill jockey has also added meteor a
 single taken from the now deleted 12 that was takemuras
 thrill jockey debut still worth hunting down for the
 stunning bside wax and wane
 those who knew takemura only through his deadly serious and
 often brilliant scope album were probably shocked by
 the inclusion of the playful cotton candyflavored sign
 on hoshi no koe here was a single heavily indebted to
 the world of nintendo with a fragile robot singing lead on
 an actual tune complete with verses a chorus and even a
 bridge the deliberately clumsy electrobeat rhythms are
 augmented by tinny casio chords and a riff from you guessed
 it a skipping cd this final touch has probably reached its
 sellby date at this point but it does at least sound new in
 this context that of sunny tweepop i like it quite a bit
 those only familiar with scope may have been shocked
 by sign but meteor is the piece that first showcased
 this side of takemuras personality though it serves as the
 prequel to sign meteor is in some respects the greater
 achievement and ranks among the finest tracks in the
 takemura oeuvre it starts with a cloud of clicks and slides
 before bringing in the trademark offkilter beats around the
 oneminute mark bit by bit other elements are introduced
 some blocky electronic percussion organ chords that cant
 quite hold it together a random assortment of beeps and
 honks and eventually a disjointed ska rhythm as the
 individual pieces fall in they never quite seem to mesh
 instead seeming to hover and vibrate in place remaining
 interesting but separate and unrelated and then about
 three minutes into meteor everything starts to gel as the
 piece increases in volume and it finally comes together in
 a brilliant crescendo meteor is like a musical jigsaw
 puzzle and when the pieces finally slide into place its
 exhilarating and supremely satisfying
 unfortunately meteor keeps going for 5xbd minutes after that
 mighty peak spreading the considerable charms of the track a
 bit thin for all his talents takemura is not the greatest
 editor a trait also demonstrated here on the 35minute
 collaboration with casey rice bundy k brown doug mccombs
 and john mcentire called souvenir in chicago i like
 sections of this piece the first third has an impressionistic
 quality that i feel is missing from the recent tortoise ive
 heard seeming to drift by on a cloud of guitar feedback
 terse bass melodies and takemuras rich synth chords and
 processing about halfway in the other players drop out and
 takemura indulges his penchant for dense abstraction again
 sections here are interesting enough but its difficult to
 tell what relationship if any these shapeless sounds have
 to the opening section of the piece eventually his
 processing seems to reference bits of sound generated by the
 other players and the interest level again rises but overall
 this track is just too long and impenetrable
 cogwheel is another interesting builder in the vein of
 hoshi no koes anemometer but the lighter tone
 allows it to blend easily with the other singles at nine
 minutes its still too long though the bonus video is
 nice pretty much capturing exactly what youd expect the
 world of sign to look like with the flatness of the early
 nintendo landscape and a story out of a video game but with
 brill
